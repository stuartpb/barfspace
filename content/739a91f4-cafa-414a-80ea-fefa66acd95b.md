# Stuartup / Unusual Studio, But It's Local

So, this note's going to be my central point of operations for this whole consultancy thing I'm currently pursuing, which is part of [my overall quest to be self-sustaining][job] (which this originally encapsulated - if you're seeing a link to this page, you probably need to go up a scope).

    - this was basically drafted in response to scammers, which I didn't realize at the time, and it kind of soured me on this whole idea

## thoughts

Ought to iron out your terms. Should there maybe be some kind of contract to sign?

## status

I did get an email from someone who was interested, and it's my own dumb fault for not following up with them.
