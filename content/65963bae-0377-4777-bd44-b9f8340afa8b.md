# We Fought a Zoo (working title)

Inspired by https://twitter.com/dannolan/status/1286792854342311937/photo/1

## scene 1 publishers office

a rich-kid photographer gets told that her photo album is no good. he throws her book in the trash.

"you've got, what, a flock of pigeons here, one's smoking a cigarette? that's nothing. anybody can get that. I took a picture of a pigeon smoking a cigarette. it's on the wall behind you. it's yesterday's fashion, honey. these subjects are all passe."

## scene 2

she's a witch. she burns a copy of the book (or the film originals? either she's a hipster or it's the pre-digital era)

an argument could be made for her photography being actually really bad, like they're all flash photos on a cell phone?

ooh, that would make it interesting to have the spell appear as each animal experiencing a "flash"

casts a spell

## scene 2a (stock footage + fx)

we see her incant the spell, as all the animals she photographed (as in, the actual subjects, which are still alive because this was on a worldwide trip a few weeks ago) get this look

a turtle starts walking toward the nearest truck stop (we linger on this shot juust long enough to be funny)

## scene 3

pigeons start hitting Tony's bedroom window. after the first few thuds, they swarm, and start pecking at it with dedication. Tony scrambles into the bathroom and makes a frantic call to Mildred, to say that The Birds, The Birds is happening, no, like, you know, like that movie The Birds

and she thinks he's talking about The Birds playing

(thought: if it's the 60s and they're using film, she could think he's saying The Byrds are playing)

he uses some item as a weapon against the pigeons, maybe puts a bucket on his head for eye protection (and keeps yanking pigeons away from the bottom where they can get to his face!) and goes Oldboy on this flock of pigeons that is attacking him. at the end, there's one pigeon on the ground, sputtering, limping away, and he picks it up and screams "WHAT IS HAPPENING? WHAT IS TH-ARE? YOU?? HNUNH? AAAAAGH!" the pigeon cocks its head back, coughs up a cigarette butt into Tony's face, and dies.

## ideas bin

- rat wall photo is choice because yikes, don't want to not pick that
- maybe someone could refuse to be in a photo at some point (receptionist in the publisher's waiting room?
  - oh damn haha what if she tells her she's a powerful witch, like, then and there, in the opening scene
    - as in, as her response, in this conversation, before she meets the publisher who blows her off
      - iff you do it in the first scene we shouldn't have any indication that witches are real
        - or any kind of to-the-audience indication other than that she's saying stuff to spook a superstitious gentle soul
      - but if you do it as a flashback, make her as obvious and all-powerful up front as possible
        - that makes the scene of the publisher ripping into her thinking he's more powerful funnier in hindsight
  - lol what if it's Lakeith Stanfeld

oh, if you do that thing with the receptionist, economy of characters dictates she should also be The Good Witch, who just wasn't letting it on in the first scene

## gag for the chalice scene

they fuss over picking the right page to burn with the all-encompassing flame

once they pick the rat page, right as the flame reaches the top Ernest says "oh, right, for convenience let's burn my page too" and throws it on, and it burns up with the rat page

when that happens Tony goes "wait, we can burn multiple pages with the fire like that?" and Mildred goes "oh, huh, I guess we could have?"

so maybe after that we have these "sparks" as she tries to conjure another fire and only re-singes parts of pages, so like one flock of eagles starts attacking a tiger (this lets the effects people hopefully take a break from just endless days of animating the rat mass)

## economy of characters: ernest the heteronormative love interest girl

so "ernest" would be someone who the photographer took a picture of who is included in the list of "creatures" implored to murder

there's also this character of "the romantic interest he did wrong and will win back in the end"

oh man okay let Ernest be nonbinary

so anyway the twist at the end of the movie is that, when Tony comes to win back Ernest, he ends up discovering they've been dating Mildred for weeks, they hooked up a little while after meeting in the big showdown at Tony's office or wherever
