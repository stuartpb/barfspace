# Stickers, Post-Its, Posters, and Reminders

This is just a big list of little prompts that I think could help put me on track. Look at me, I'm a middle school classroom.

I'm not a big fan of doing these on a schedule, but having them in an Oblique Strategies like fortune file or something like that might not be a bad idea.

- [ ] Write some things on post-its and put 'em on your monitor:
  - [ ] "Slow Down, Be Kind"
  - [ ] "Feeling stuck? Breathe"
