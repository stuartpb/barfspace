# what Clark County knew

There was a lot of debate when Crabs in a Barrel first aired about this remark from Clark County to Earn:

"It was gold, too. Shit was clean, though. Wish it was mine."

Folks were debating whether or not Clark realized Earn had planted the gun in his bag, or even if Clark actually knew Luke had put it in his bag instead of Clark's.

Thinking it over right now, at 2 AM about a year later (you know, like you do), here's my read on it: not only does Clark know Earn put the gun in his bag, he knows *it wasn't Earn's gun*, because Earn isn't someone who'd be carrying *anything*, and if he's going through airport security with some Castor Troy shit like that, it's because he was holding it for someone like Al.

Clark knows that Earn planted it, but further, he knows that *framing him wasn't the main motivation*, that even if Earn *wanted* a piece like that, he couldn't hold onto it

eh i was going somewhere with this, but, eh, fuck it. the general idea is that this gets back to Clark County highlighting not only that he can have shit like that, but that Earn *couldn't* - he's playing on that shame, that Earn had something Clark valued, and it's like Belloc in Raiders of the Lost Ark, "once again, that which was so briefly yours is now mine". Even though the actual gun doesn't become Clark's, the *status it conveys*, in this moment, is taken all the same: the fact that Clark can merely *consider* the prospect is all the flex he needs to remind Earn that *Clark has taken something that Earn will not be allowed to have*.
