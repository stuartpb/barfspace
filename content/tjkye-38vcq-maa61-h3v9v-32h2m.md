# A Thought about Mom

I hope I can play more story games with her. I played Fiasco with her once.

I think it's a shame she never really got to get into role-playing games.

I feel a bit of similarity between her and Beth's second mom in The Queen's Gambit, and Beatrice Horseman, and I guess Betty Draper? These were all women of her mother's generation, but I could feel it echo through her, feeling less trapped than they were, but still not truly fulfilled.
