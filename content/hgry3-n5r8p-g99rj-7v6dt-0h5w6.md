# Base32 GCode?

It strikes me that any sequence of Base32 that does not use I, L, O, or U can be rendered in Crockford's Base32 (or other letter omissions for other Base32 formats: not base32hex, though, as that would critically cut off )

## intersection into document system model

So anyway, this could be used as a form of "literal" for a one-line expression defining a "source" for an injection in the "tool change sequence" stack

and you could have a translation level that recognizes `T "ptacl://mnt/petg"` or something like that as a way of specifying a symbol that can specify sub-symbols

overlap with [Okay, But Seriously, Base32 Address Space](rmjve-fe322-4ybtc-rw68d-4w0w4)

this intersects the whole "document system CI layers" model - can Argo CD

OOZY SEWER: arrest that catchphrase

[Printacle "Odometer Card" Material Resource Pressure Tool Scheduling System](nk586-7dpxf-8pajm-d6ynk-gxh4s)

extending ultimately to [Printacle CI/CD Integration(esque) Model](5359r-v4yxp-16b0n-vnj5r-wf2cs)
