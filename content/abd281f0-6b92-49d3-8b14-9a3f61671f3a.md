# How Ingress and Exposure are structured on Stubernetes

As of 2020-06-04, the only active outside-facing services on Stubernetes are the household-internal ones. They are implemented as LoadBalancer IPs assigned by MetalLB, with `.internal` domain names served by the loose Deployments that make up Household DNS.

[Planning and Exploration](9ac503ed-a6d8-4fc3-996b-d1e94d18e139.md) is about half dedicated to expansion / refinements on this model.
