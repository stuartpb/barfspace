# On Coroutines in Understanding Lua

## Notes from OneNote

> Maybe little dioramas or the room? I plan to pretty much forget about these as soon as I mention them, and they are, for the most part, identical to userdata.
>
> Maybe they're like TVs.

## Comments from Trello: "Oh, there's also coroutines."

> But that's so irrelevant to anything I'm going to discuss for like the entire book. Understanding coroutines can be an important part of understanding things like the asynchronous programming model used in projects like NodeJS, but first I have to explain what the standard libraries are, and to explain how the standard libraries work I need to explain tables and functions, and basically just forget about this.

> And coroutines are effectively just Lua's own internal userdata anyway, for all the ways you can interact with them,
