# Adventures in 3D Printing

Aggregating all my pages touching 3D printing, and then some (including experiment journals and papercuts and that kind of thing, kind of crossing News and other slices like that):

- [Upgrade arc][3dpq], for Quests that affect the printer itself
- [Maker Quests][], which usually involve 3D printing
  - [Print Ideas by Filament][PIbF]
- [Everybody Gets a Factory][EGAF]
