# Internal, Invisible, and Legacy Details in Email

## Parenthesized "Comments"

one of the stranger email concepts to understand.

Best I can figure, they're left in the spec as a sort of "reserved syntactic space" (ie. they could be used for a Variable Address type thing, even though they weren't)

but they're really here just to cover older systems using a non-standard technique to specify address holders

And also, these are used in places like npm as a way of specifying one's website

[RFC 5322's Appendix A.5](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5322#appendix-A.5) provides a clear example of what's allowed with these, and how they're to be ignored

## Variable Addresses

This leads into Gmail's "plus addresses"
