# Evil Genius Kubernetes Provisioning

Evil Genius is actually kind of a brilliantly simple way to model Nodes

You can assign nodes as Guards, Scientists, or Valets

Valets handle your frontend (see [Kubic Cockpit Kiosk Model](kec23-c7jz4-mg8km-5sd25-n3h0g))

the Scientists probably handle stateful data

and these'd be things you enforce with tains, tolerations, annotations, roles...
