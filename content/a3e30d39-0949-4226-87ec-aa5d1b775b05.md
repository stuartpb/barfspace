This is a hub for pages that collect my notes on 3D printing in general.

Its main dump is [this page for various tips and guides](ff08355c-904d-4c3f-a045-0f327bfd6b9b.md)

Near here:

- [Build Logs and Maker Ideas](b2694758-f919-4d46-a29b-7bbf189eab38.md)
  - covers the workshop of *things and projects I'm working on*
  - not about general theory like this page
- [Everybody gets a Factory](8cbd867d-1a63-4d1f-9c83-cab019fe87bd.md)
  - the "Lean Notes of Becoming a Maker"
  - a primer to just becoming a person who can build anything they get an idea for physically (the way Lean Notes goes for that, but in web software).

## draft essay

- [Is Prusa Going the Way of Makerbot?](5ce33d60-5385-4aed-a86d-4b46190d6057.md)

## things as I'm learning multi-material printing

- [You Very Much Do Need a Wipe Tower](91879ff9-7644-428f-87c8-3bfe87357dde.md)

## material thoughts

weird that https://blog.prusaprinters.org/may-2019-update-original-prusa-sl1-now-shipping-powder-coated-sheets-in-stock-prusaslicer-2-0-and-much-more/ describes the system as having been tested on PETG and CPE when https://toms3d.org/2018/02/05/things-know-petg/ claims they're the same thing and https://filament2print.com/gb/copolyesters-pet/890-cpe-hg100.html says it's "[chlorinated polyethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorinated_polyethylene)"?

this should be sorted out in the [Material][] note entry for this

## Ideas for more pages

- Filament Notes, a place to say "this PLA is stringy as hell" and "this black PETG seems more tempermental than my yellow PETG" and stuff like that
  - This is distinct from the [Everybody Gets a Factory Materials page][EGAFM], as that's for *material types in general*, and these would be for documenting *my specific experiences with specific reels of filament*
- How to Make Circuits, explaining all the different ways to hook components up: solder, twisting wires, solder paste, DuPont pins, copper tape, conductive thread... also, you know, traditional PCB fabrication (which you can't generally do yourself at home, making it kind of out-of-scope for EGAF).
  - Meh, I mean, now that I think about it, Everybody Gets a Factory is supposed to be about what's involved in scaling up production, so you can gradually expand / outsource production on a fully-documented trajectory - and could maybe start talking about how to cooperatively and ethically structure material ownership of the means of production as this scales up
  - In other words, this is totally in scope, and this should be worked into that tree as part of the Introduction or something like that
