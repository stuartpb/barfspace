# 2018-09-02: the partitioning continues

Using `parted`, I was able to `resizepart 1 2047s`, but changing the start locations of the other two seemed like it'd be pretty much impossible, so I'm just going to go ahead and delete + recreate them in cgdisk.

Okay, now that that's done (and the other two partitions are now aligned on 8-sector boundaries, as recommended by http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-4kb-sector-disks/ at the command line when checking the partition table for optimal layout).

## formatting and mounting

Running `sudo mkfs.fat -F32 /dev/sdc2` and `sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc3`

Mounting with `sudo bash -c 'mount /dev/sdc3 /mnt && mkdir /mnt/boot && mount /dev/sdc2 /mnt/boot'`

## pacstrapping and installing

installing all the packages I'd wished I'd had when I was starting with stuzzy (including a couple I can bootstrap off of the machine itself) `sudo pacstrap -c /mnt base base-devel bash-completion elinks lightdm lightdm-gtk-greeter gnome xorg-server networkmanager ttf-croscore ttf-roboto noto-fonts noto-fonts-cjk noto-fonts-emoji noto-fonts-extra opendesktop-fonts ttf-ubuntu-font-family`

setting the mounts with `sudo bash -c 'genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab'`

chrooting in with `sudo arch-chroot /mnt`

## in chroot

now basically following the procedure from stuzzy changelog 2018-08-30 pretty directly:

`ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/Los_Angeles /etc/localtime` and `hwclock --systohc`

running `sed -i 's/#en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8 UTF-8/' /etc/locale.gen` followed by `locale-gen`, then `echo 'LANG=en_US.UTF-8' > /etc/locale.conf`

running `echo sturling > /etc/hostname` (which is not reflected in the prompt, tbh I think this part of the Installation Guide ought to just use `hostnamectl`)

## mkinitcpio

I'm going to rebuild the initrd using the systemd hook like on stuzzy, and, per the advice of https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installing_Arch_Linux_on_a_USB_key, I'm also going to move the `block` hook up (and remove `autodetect`, which isn't written anywhere, but is clear from the comments is appropriate).

I run `sed -i 's/^HOOKS=.*$/HOOKS=(base systemd block modconf filesystems keyboard fsck)/' /etc/mkinitcpio.conf` to clobber the existing hooks array, then run `mkinitcpio -p linux` to rebuild the ramdisks.

## installing GRUB

diverging from the process used to build stuzzy here, as I'm looking to make a system that can boot from both UEFI and BIOS, and the simplest way to run that appears to be to use GRUB, so:

derp, forgot to plan ahead and pacstrap for `pacman -S grub efibootmgr`

installing the BIOS loader with `grub-install --target=i386-pc /dev/sdc` and the UEFI loader with `grub-install --target=x86_64-efi --removable --efi-directory=/boot --bootloader-id=GRUB`

I don't think I need to mess with the default GRUB configuration any so I just run `grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg`

looks like that should be it

## enabling services

`systemctl enable lightdm NetworkManager`

## adding my user

`EDITOR=nano visudo` to uncomment the line enabling wheel members to sudo (*with* a password, since I'm approaching opsec under sturling slightly differently than stuzzy, for essentially arbitrary reasons)

`useradd -c "Stuart P. Bentley" -m -G wheel stuart && passwd stuart`

okay, I think I've got that working, so I'm going to exit the chroot, save and push the changelog thus far, and reboot to see if stuzzy will reboot into GRUB on sturling.

if so, I'm going to continue with the Grand Plan Sturling Mark III World Tour (We're Getting The Band Back Together) currently outlined in stuzzy/plan.md and reboot the stutendo/stushiba desktop machine into sturling to recover stushiba (at which point the documentation/focus of this Special Crossover Event will move over to sturling).

## rebooting

The reboot was a success. I connected to my Wi-Fi using the GNOME menu, and ma now going to set up an AUR helper and Google Chrome the same way as I did on stuzzy:

`cd $(mktemp -d) && bash <(curl https://meta.sh/aur) -si yay`

this causes Git to be installed as a runtime dependency, and `go` to be installed as a buildtime dependency.

I figure I can probably wait until I'm not itching to reboot back into stuzzy to install Google Chrome via `yay`, so I'm just going to `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096` real quick to generate a pubkey for this device (one I will probably add to GitHub via stuzzy or stushiba once I've booted back into one of those and can mount the sturling root partition).

I give this key no passphrase; at this point, I'm starting to realize my "have `sudo` prompt for passwords" idea isn't making a lot of sense relative to how I generally do things, and that the more coorect way to do this would probably be to have an **encrypted root volume** (or, if Chrome saves cookies and stuff under /home, an encrypted /home is probably good enough): that'll have to be first on my plan.md (and I should probably hold off on adding the pubkey I just generated as an authorized key to access my GitHub until I've got that figured out).
