# The Historium of the Notegraph

This is the division of the [Academy of Belfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j) (which, like the Oozy Sewer, broke off to its own entity so the acronym "HOTBAND" would work) that holds the artifacts and histories of the content of these notes.

The historium is divided into two fields:

- [Stuart P. Bentley's Content Through the Ages](v8rhb-279v2-mp8k3-v3jd5-wr08h)
- [the Museum of Notegraph History](fq5xy-qs35h-4na65-vgnnf-dp6zv)

And, of course, content that moves in and/or out of these notes ends up spanning both fields, because Everything Is a Mess.
