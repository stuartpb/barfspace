So there's this manic energy about this repo that I like, and I feel like going into a little more detail on the motivations behind it

I mean, a lot of the files in here are kind of clumsy musings around this idea, but, like, there's some insight that I've had toward this that, okay, so

I think someone made an app called "Hemingway" that actually had the backspace key disabled under the philosophy of Hemingway's line "Write drunk, edit sober", so that, like, fixing mistakes involved an explicit context switch?

UPDATE: while there is a Hemingway app that attempts to mimic Ernest Hemingway's philosophy, and it does have both "Write" and "Edit" modes, the "Write" mode doesn't disable backspace (though that might be a feature they patched out in one of their newer versions - they don't keep a changelog, grr - see unstuck-in-time.md), and apparently the "write drunk, edit sober" line is apocryphal (which could be why they removed it - I can't find any record of an app like the one I'm describing on Google, so it's probably this one.)

Anyway that's basically what led to me writing the autocommit script (and not giving a crap that it's clumsy)

but yeah perfectionism and, like, "sucking at something's being the first step at being kinda good at something"

I should really make a note somewhere for anybody who's worried about how messy these are that I have a rule that I only work on this repository when I'm sober (partially because the autocommit script commits and forcepushes everything I write to a public GitHub repo every ten seconds, lol)

Okay, so, like, a thing is, I kind of feel trapped in this style. Like, if I've got all these commits, and they're messy, and then I've got other commits where I'm trying *not* to be messy?

Yeah, like, I think *this* was the big thing I was trying to avoid by not having an autocommit script... I wanted it to be a thing where I'm always working on having the contents of the directory make sense *eventually*

Which is a thing I kind of touched on in the-thing-about-weird-twitter, I started talking about how just barfing everything all the time in a mania isn't helpful

You know... I think "autocommit on" and "autocommit off" are kind of my two Hemingway modes for this repo. I can turn autocommit off when I know what I'm writing, and I can turn it on for when I'm dragging my feet on shipping.

nice
