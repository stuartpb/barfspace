# Frameworks and Scaffolds

These are for project ideas that are meant to be used as a base for bigger things, or something like that

see [Components, Features, and Parts](sgm3d-n5d7z-ra8jx-4r3y6-cd6rp) for projects that, like these, can touch a lot of other projects, but from the opposite direction

[Spec ideas](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t) is kind of like this, too

- [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) (the tools and spec that govern barfspace itself)
- [wayside](46qjk-agdzr-a58ez-vypmf-3hxay)
  - the [Metabrowser windowsystem](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k) also presents a framework
- [Module Tree (plushu et al)](237wy-vyzdz-w39y5-va8ej-3r5g6)
- [NilPass](frbht-aas1n-jp9rb-m0spq-f23mj) (kind of, in that it blends "components" like Hashblot/splat)
- [printacle](v62a9-2ccas-m5a21-pppj8-966e8)
- [smooth customizable app/extension UI scaffolding](b6sd2-tz9z2-rs8gn-pjdm2-2rp4v)

## sort of scaffolding-ish?

- [casettic](9azcz-vmh01-gk9as-jda8t-94kej) lays out a storage model that could be used as a springboard for other stuff
