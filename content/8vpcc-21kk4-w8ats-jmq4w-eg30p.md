# inkscape tweak

I've turned off "Show font samples in dropdown". The Inkscape dropdown is miserable with as many fonts as I have, and is no way to inspect specimens: the easy way is really just to go to fonts.google.com, since that's pretty much where they're all from. (You can also use the built-in GNOME font viewer - point is, you use something external.)
