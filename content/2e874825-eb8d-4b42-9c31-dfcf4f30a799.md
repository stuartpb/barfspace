# Changes I'm thinking I'd like to make to some standing listings on the Unusual Studio Projects list

Some of these can probably take the form of [Barfspace Vision Quest][BVQ] items

[BVQ]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md

SACRED should be interwoven with my notes more (I've merged this into the [Project Akira][] quests, to be revisited as I explore those notions)

[Project Akira]: dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md

the Open Dictionary of Reserved Words should be redone as a Markdown repo, I think I settled on that a while ago

https://unusual.studio/projects/#29b020ea-0851-4ca0-9e1f-87119fd2c71c has been specced out within bagtent since we flew out to Orlando

Bagtent should be a thing in this list

Writing the Ship should be moved into Notes, same probably goes for Gullibot

In fact, the old "Help Wanted" repo should just be turned into a note - and the new "Help Wanted" repo can just be about navigating the current mish-mash-hodge-podge

Timetress could be another one that could be worked into a schema in Bagtent

Should probably note that I know how I want to implement the CSS dimmer thing

Should also have context for why I want to make the open Perspective Quantities data set? Maybe it should be community-based, where folks can vote "practical" (ie. "length of a football field"), "intriguing" (ie. when it's an interesting factoid, but not one you'd readily be familiar with), or "boring" (when it's neither)

This is an odd thought that doesn't pertain to Unusual Studio, but I can't quite think of where else to put it: a blob somewhere in this repo for household walkthrough guides, like "How to Wash Dishes", explaining that you should at least rinse them in the sink first, because that's not the dishwarsher's function

Also: Adventures in 3D Printing, a nexus linking off to a page with How to Place your PINDA and Why and How The Wizard Works, because it's not particularly well-documented right now
