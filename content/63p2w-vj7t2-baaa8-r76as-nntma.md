# The Notestack Engineering Core

[The Red-Hot :100: Execution Plan](g5cfr-x437j-m8azb-qje0h-qk3mf)

This group has split off from the [Department of Barfspace](xcf83-y2s77-w59jc-21g12-032mn), as the DoB hold jurisdiction over the content of the notes, and the NEC don't generally interact with the notes' content, except where said content is informed by implementation details.

For pages involving my current activity (Notestack or otherwise - because, in a way, it's *all* above, below, or alongside The Notestack), check [Right Now](84grq-16d12-65bj6-m6bt5-s1h4a).

## Adjacent

For notes on improving my general tech ecosystem, see [Desktop Quests](8hded-p2qjr-yq8cj-3g9j7-bq7gr).

For non-actionable reflections on these notes (or for tasks where the action is just "reflect more"), see the [Academy of Barfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j).

[The Shadow Curtain](wm7ba-3ycgc-wn8h2-pjnsv-xny45) is currently in need of a lot of implementation consideration: it's also hosting an outgrowth that's already dropped out [Thoughts on storing private content on an on-person IoT Git server](hvjcw-eyqqh-rhafq-wh7a2-7qwph)

This crosscuts many of the below notes - I need the same CI stack to run privately, and able to interlink seamlessly with the public-stack, like having links to an Intranet for myself

- There also need to be considerations given to how a page can migrate out from one and into another.
  - This gets explored under the [Bagtent Federation and Distribution Hub](nfwjw-tvvm0-gkb2e-k3xhv-h6f7k)

## Documents Under This Department's Purview

- [The Structure of This Repo](ps8vc-ams0t-gx98e-wkt6f-42myq)
- [bagtent hub](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3), as "bagtent" is starting to turn into something more like a specific set of tools to this workspace, and reflections on what I'm doing here within the domain of the [Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma).

## Bagtent Notes of Special Notestack Engineering Concern

## Outstanding Challenges

- [The Shotclock and Integrity](vwjtn-pkzhg-gc9ff-2h6sj-nddpy)
- [More on the Shotclock and Editor Stuff](gce70-57wc8-03805-sevfd-db955)
- [Profiling and parallelizing Node scripts](76kaf-n67bs-vxayb-s85yv-j0pms)
  - for bagtent-validate
- [note on bagtent-conjure](vq7sp-3yj7a-ge8kv-9gzcj-rh40c)
- [Possible Git Flow](h02h4-89fge-408dk-jgetg-15c4x)
  - [Editor History as a WIP Branch](1dzb3-gbj93-ma8t8-p06mh-3j1mh)
- [A Stack for Mobile](n8ay6-vfs3z-wc9m7-bqhpb-gqyw4)
- [Linting and Rigging Markdown](v01w8-tcqk3-wp80m-qyps6-veqxz)
  - [A Feast for Prose](gt833-j4kxw-838mc-41gzw-9w90a) - automatic proofreading and the like
- [Macros and Crap](gtaf6-82afe-0jaf7-23v3j-bjs8y) (thoughts on templates)
- [An IPFS Publishing Cloud](dzdxx-09cz0-td9m4-hhwj1-19vrc)
- [Some kind of device for syncing the private data](h9tj4-xrdjc-mdamq-yqk76-effm5) beyond The Shadow Curtain
- very simple: [obsolete CONTRIBUTING.md](zsbwa-bx3f8-8vata-qbs72-rx3wq)

## Under Consideration

- [Unusual Studio Projects Notesification](2kxcv-axa9h-eaast-sp16j-wvg0f)

## Missions In Progress

- [Sprint for Shotclock and Integrity](hemw3-h4qam-gcaf8-0t8kt-qc6az)
- [Closing Time](pz3ey-e0160-wvanm-a0xcr-tv94w), for developing and implementing a suitable implementation for the editing side of the stack that isn't Cloud9 (closing) or GitPod (cost-prohibitive, unless we can swing a sponsorship from them).

## Mostly-finished Missions

(there's always a little more followthrough to do, but, you know, I'm too much of a slacker to do extra credit and all)

- [Cleaning Up the Repo](rpwj6-q22kf-c29er-7ds0p-b4p8e)
