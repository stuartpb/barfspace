# The Spiral Mountain of Design and Social Psychology

This is a hub for the subject that led most of my original ["messays"](hwhnk-bgrdy-4rbbs-9kyf0-qfsrw).

This was originally supposed to be a set of guidelines surrounding the drafting of technical specifications, but as it sprawls in scope, it can also be interpreted as a set of guidelines around any sort of design, and, in a broader interpretation, as [an abstract philosophy of life][ZAMM] (with shout-outs to the driving philosophies of others).

All opinions expressed are my own, except the Robustness Principle was Jon Postel's.

Also cribbing from [The Design of Everyday Things][] and [The Pragmatic Programmer][].

Subject to interpretation. Follow at your own risk and/or benefit (risk and/or benefit not guaranteed).
