# About the PNY Elite-X

As [I flash the June 10 Kubic install DVD](apqev-my4ak-mzbtq-09rsa-dcac5) onti this 64GB drive, I see it only doing a speed of about 30Mb/s...

- did the brownouts actually damage this drive?
  - [Tom's Hardware claims that's not possible](https://forums.tomshardware.com/threads/brown-outs-what-was-damaged-and-is-anything-else-at-risk.2405698/)
- maybe it's a mutually-unfriendly firmware problem, idk.
- I suppose this is something to look into later when evaluating if the drive would be appropriate as the new "work storage" disk
  - which, yeah, as a class, I think I'm just gonna call "work" this time
- hmm, [the amazon reviews](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LFV52Y6/) suggest slow writes are a known property of this disk
  - it's great for reads, though
- I suppose this would work best as part of [a Logical Volume fleet of equal drives](jwtbs-jfj7f-8mawe-fdfg4-a5hwe)
  - that would, I think, allow writes to be parallelizable?
- Bottom line, I think:
  - this disk with its slow writes is "okay" for work volumes on Longhorn
  - the flash drive is better as the root
