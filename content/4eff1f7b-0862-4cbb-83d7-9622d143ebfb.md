# Binder (Explorer / Finder System)

this was the idea for Binder (partially - the internal data source for icons and bookmarks, and customizing those, was also a thing, as part of a browser extension - and incorporating scriptlets was also a part)

might have notes around this in Google Keep?

it bubbled up in an idea to use it [for kubernetes](989ccbc6-fd86-454c-ae87-21b20a54e479.md)
