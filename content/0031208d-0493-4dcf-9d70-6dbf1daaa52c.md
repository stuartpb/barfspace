# Toolchained Melody

This is like a little redundant version of the Projects page just for projects that are tools. It's a legacy from Quests.

Idea for how this page could be repurposed: some kind of "tech tree" overview, showing how development on each of these influences others? I don't know, this is kind of a weird stub
