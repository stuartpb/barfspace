# stumez ACPI aggravation

I think hitting ctrl+alt+del a few times, and/or rebooting with `reboot=acpi` or `reboot=bios` at least once, resolved this problem I was having? but wpc-gomez was in this situation where it would freeze up when invoking a reboot, with a kernel dump every thirty seconds.

anyway, this page can be where I track that, keep an eye on it
