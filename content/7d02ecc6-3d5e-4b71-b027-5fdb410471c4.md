This is [The Engine](9b28ea65-6375-4536-81e2-cf98e6d59858.md) that runs at the hard-simulation layer

## Setting

The engine was built to handle elaborate sci-fi/fantasy projections onto it, inspired by how the Quake engine was originally designed to model iD's tabletop RPG sessions. In practice, at the point our story is set, the narrative logic to access these mechanisms is undiscovered

## Plot Engine

The episode-to-episode and/or scene-to-scene transition (ie. the Plot Engine) is modeled on 5D Chess. I'm thinking Commander King might actually be the king piece for the Black Army (the Allies)

The fifth dimension has no way to access it but by hacking, but it's present in the simulation, maintained as either a diagnostic tool or a future mechanic, and it operates by the rules of 5D Chess, where all timelines exist until one team captures the King, at which point the winning team controls both sides of the consensus and can retroactively erase whatever states from the bifurcation

## Scene Engine

At the moment-to-moment level, the engine is modeled something like Doom:

- A room can have elevation, but going "up stairs" requires a logistical cut
  - you physically can not have the staircase shootout from Inglourious Basterds
    - this is one of the memories that drives Jason Innput mad
      - "But how can you shoot on a staircase? You can't be 'on' a staircase. You can *take* a staircase, but you're always in one room or another..."
        - Shades of Pioneer 9 waking up after trying to access a negative number in 20020
