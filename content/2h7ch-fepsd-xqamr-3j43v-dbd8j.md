# Note nexus for OPWS

There's so much cool stuff I'm finding with API Blueprint and tools around that that I'm thinking this'll be the next thing I want to do with OPWS

TODO: Paste those links in here

Indeed, it's weird, because this stuff that's coming out now is what I intended to make like five years ago, I think there are even commits for it

Is it possible to write migration / translation / conversion / mapping code using an API definition thing like this? That could be neat

making a note that I had some thoughts on API while looking at [Kubernetes](yynnd-jg6vf-4p813-td1c7-e8y0s)
