# Open Platform All the Things

A thing I think about sometimes is that any sufficiently-genericized technology should have an open-source base that that hardware can be built from.

See also the SACRED properties, for what these initiatives would focus on

- [Drones](snrsq-r2vfg-m3ask-yfdke-v58cb)
  - There's already open software platforms - just extend that to hardware
- [Mice / input peripherals](5a616-x34dg-9vadj-10bpz-fgkew)
- [RISC-V](6m17a-61z2h-jxan1-yjzm9-4rv0n) - ultimately, even the chips should be open
