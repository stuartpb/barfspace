## bagtent stuff

Want to revive w5-graph as a bagtent just called "whoswho" that has even looser notoriety guidelines and is just in general way less strict about everything - the proposed structure of the YAML files is basically like that, but for lines with internal (and external) links instead of k:v pairs, and oh hey now we can have freeform metadata content that isn't directly link-based, and we don't break external references if something changes (and we don't have to do tricky fancy footwork to rewrite internal references worrying that we might break something if we don't update a name correctly)
