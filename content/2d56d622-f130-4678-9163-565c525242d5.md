## the setting

So, this wouldn't be mentioned within the context of this first episode, but the whole "war" is actually a hybrid simulation, based on the structure of RPGs, which were originally wargames: see [The Easter Witch](6afe9432-b98b-4dc1-abda-c817ebf29c6f.md)

## influences

The story overall:

- Raiders of the Lost Ark
- Hellboy
- Con Air
  - the whole plot with "Foo"

Specific influences on the stuff with Jason:

- Good Will Hunting
- The Bit Player
- The Knick
  - The whole "geniuses who becomes increasingly self-medicated and erratic" trope

# selling points

If I were trying to convey what I think someone would find cool about this story:

- magical realism so real I've considered actually implementing it instead of just describing it
