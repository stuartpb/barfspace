# A Model for Kateskit Boxes

this is about partitioning and shipping

also, my new current working name for this is "HiveBug"

uh, let's just go ahead and ignore that that's a furry/tentacle porn Twitter handle (really should have checked that before I bought the domain...)

## hardware outlay

each HiveBug has an onboard disk and the onboard SSD / MicroSD

each HiveBug also comes with installation / recovery media, as a microsd card in a USB reader

the purpose of this is to serve as an alternative boot source if the system gets messed up by an automatic update

## how they're formatted

The onboard SSD is formatted the way k3os does it: one installation, and the updater handles overwriting.

the hard disk is one big bulk partition

## install disk / recover media

The install media, however, is different: it reserves the first part of the partition not needed for 2x the install media

This boot section includes all the UEFI stuff to boot, as well as the top-level configuration (which inlcudes the pre-flashed cluster)
