# Post-RMA Stuixel

went to Setup, enabled USB debugging, did reboot bootloader, tried to unlock and got a "not enabled" thing

rebooted, went into settings, connected to Wifi and turned "Allow OEM unlock" on

rebooted and did "unlock" and it worked but following it with "unlock_critical" said "device already unlocked" so I re-locked it, then redid the whole thing again (didn't have to re-enable OEM unlock) and did "unlock_critical" this time since, hey maybe that's better (I feel like this is how it went down last time)

set up, restored backup, did update, re-factoried, went through setup and restored backup again. didn't have to give a voice profile the second time for whatever reason
