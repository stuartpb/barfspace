# Problem Base

This is a page for aggregating various software issues I've found but not reported, and other things in my life that bother me (mostly in a desktop/mobile sense, but that scope might expand - we'll see how this continues).

As they say, necessity is the mother of invention: some of these might evolve into full-featured projects to fix the issues they identify. Others will probably just lead to a simple pull request.

Single-system issues (ie. "I broke X"), which tend to be more forensic in nature than inventive, will be found listed on pages for their corresponding [pet systems](3gdqf-ewy6z-8a9vm-jvnyz-ew5gn).

See also [Desktop Quests](8hded-p2qjr-yq8cj-3g9j7-bq7gr) for general improvements

For broken physical objects, see [Junkyard Daydreams](6eyb4-2tx40-q58xe-gnagc-85s4a).

## Per-system problem indices

- [stushiba problems](fa145-g7pzg-p1a0x-xh41d-wnssx)

## General problems

- [Volume Level Normalization](0qaa2-5ps61-pd9n8-spz0y-ebv4n)
  - Solutions are currently based around Linux and mpv, but that scope could probably expand.
- [typing in the dark](whjpm-j0gmh-04ay8-qt4tn-b1xwt)
  - like, honestly, I guess it's just uncommon that I have a problem that doesn't immediately turn into a project, outside of system issues like these? but this page seems like it should be broader

## Linux problems

- [O Brother, Why Can't I Print From Thou?](0bx1y-zf1fz-2da8f-drkyk-acfry)
- Chromium emoji issue
  - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/refs/heads/master/media-libs/fontconfig/files/local.conf may give insights as to how to fix that

## Specific tickets

- [flashair won't connect to wifi](gnhka-hp3c5-mm91z-339q7-y1hdg)
