# NodeMCU and Espressif chips

This can be a page aggregating all my NodeMCU notes and projects, including documentation I've been yoinking.

- [postdark][]

[postdark]: f83f237b-3d81-4e2b-85d1-4686cb1f2e49.md

there're another couple projects that are currently just in the planning stages that I'm currently thinking I'd use an ESP8266 for:

- [a slideshow module for postdark][postrs]
- [a WS2812 necklace][necklace] (there should probably also be a page for WS2812s, really, especially since I'm planning to try controlling them from the Raspberry Pi at some point)

[postrs]: 6a9b637f-17b4-45e4-92ac-ae7161894b8f.md
[necklace]: 6dc617ce-7fc0-4c57-937e-2656af78f664.md

I might use something like this for a future revision to my [Infinity Gauntlet][MBIG] design (though, at this point, I think I'll hold off on anything like that for a few years until a really good Infinity Gauntlet model comes along to use as a basis, since I'm realizing now that the one I'm basing my current build on is kind of rough and clumsy)

## Data Sheets and Pinout Diagrams

https://hackaday.io/project/61727-rhobythe-social-robot/log/157461-ke32-wrover-c10-pinout has a couple good links:

- [this image summarizing the pinout for the breakout chip I'm using][ESP32 pin table]
- [the underlying datasheet for the ESP32][ESP32 datasheet]
