# sturling (mk 2)

These are the logs from the last time I tried to build a persistent x64 Arch Linux installation on a microSD card; I'm not sure what USB device I was attempting this on, or where it is, or even if it still works. I'm probably going to bring up a new system by this name soon, and I'll write a more elaborate description/postmortem of these previous incarnations then.
