# Glitchless or something

I have a lot of *old* notes for this concept that I don't really know how to share just yet

[Here's some dialogue that would work for something and some weird improvised character name stuff][bones]

## New pitch

Glitchless is a problem-solving company. They're, at first blush, debugging consultants: you come to them under the auspices that you have a problem in your software.

But that's not what they're actually there for. They're like the A-Team: you call them in for when your problem is *actually* social. They advertise this: they talk about how sometimes the problem can be an overwhelmed secretary who just needed a listening ear (which is fucking sexist, but they don't point that out), or an overworked executive who just needed more vacation time and a second secretary (which is even worse). However, they're usually brought in to sniff out a corrupt manager, or an abusive VP,

Anyway, it's all a communist plot - the real purpose of Glitchless is to destroy capitalism by exposing the moral decay that is omnipresent at the highest tiers of the system.
