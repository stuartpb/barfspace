# Pirates of the Bloodstream

We were in Disney World, and Pirates of the Carribean was different - a lot of Epcot stuff jumbled together, like the attraction now held all the stuff that Maelstrom discarded when it was converted to Frozen Ever After

We then got on a truck, going back(?) for some reason, and this is where we met with our fence or whatever, played by Nicholas Cage, who explained the real reason we were there: Blood Piracy. Shady dealers giving out second-hand blood, with warnings on it about the donor's original condition (complete with icons in red circles like Universal's ride warnings) like "HAD A COLD", "LUNG CANCER", "TORNADO AFTERMATH", "DRAWN FROM NICHOLAS CAGE"

For some reason, Nic didn't feel like he had to be in the driver's seat of the truck, even as we started going downhill - we ended up halfway into a gift shop, and I had to get out through the passenger-side window and climb over a wall onto the ride exit ramp (you know what I mean).
