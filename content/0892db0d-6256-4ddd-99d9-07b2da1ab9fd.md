# Understanding Lua: Background

TODO: Explain how I had this idea back in 2009 or so, and how it went from VR idea, to comic book idea, to VR idea, to back to this

I had written down a few ideas for this as a OneNote notebook, which I proptly lost / forgot about a year later. At some point between when I had the idea to do this as a comic book and when VR became a real possibility, I put together an outline for this as a pair of Trello boards (one for the introductory content, and one for the substance): this document, in its first iteration, represents a transcription and elaboration of the outline that was there previously.

This Markdown document represents a working "script" for an illustrator to work from. Code blocks would be presented alongside the panel: I'm thinking that pages would be wide, with half-to-two-thirds of the page consisting of panels, and the outside half/third of the page being a margin with code and editorial "comments".

Right now, the text isn't *completely* in descriptive form: some of the preface might be in full-page text (a la the preface from Understanding Comics). After the preface, I'll probably be working on making visual suggestions for the first couple chapters of introduction, then I'll be describing the panels for the actual Dashseat scenes in more visual detail.
