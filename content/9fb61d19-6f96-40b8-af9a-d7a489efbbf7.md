# dockitall headbanger log

had to reduce `$fn` to get it to slice without missing bits

drive gear nut slipped off, causing squeaking and only incidental extrusion

(found it inside the extruder attached to the vestigial magnet)

## status

the extruder makes a real screwy clicking / rattling when turning while empty, might want to look into that
