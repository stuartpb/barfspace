# Paint Spoons

To go with the Paint Knives.

These are spoons with defined volume (ie. microliters) that you can scoop paint from a tube with and know just how much you're mixing in, for reproducing the color later.

should probably be a hemisphere roughly the diameter of the nozzle (working backwards to find the parameters needed for an even number of microliters, given the natural size, would make sense) - for greater measured volumes, can be extended down the length of the spoon (the "trench" design making it easy to fill from a tube).

can even have a graduated trough

Round-tipped knives go well with this - the parametric thing seems handy right now
