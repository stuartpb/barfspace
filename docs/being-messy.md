# The Sincerity of Sloppiness

This is an attempt to consolidate some of the thoughts that have been lingering around in meta-textual messes like hemingway-style.md and the-thing-about-weird-twitter.md.

In fact, fuck it, I'm going to go ahead and merge those files into this one.

Actually, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to iterate by rewriting what I wrote there... like *actual, honest to god drafts*. Shit, this repo might be making me adopt generally-accepted good writing habits. Shit.

Mania doesn't come naturally to me, and I'm not super comfortable within it. Last Friday, I tried slopping out some text here in barfspace in a manic dash to express myself, and I felt drained, more drained than I necessarily had to.

Keeping things tidy feels *good* to me, in some contexts. It's ironic, because my apartment is always a mess, but my *work*, I can't stand a single stray hair in the logic of.

But I worry that my *natural style* being this semi-rehearsed, practiced, rhythmic thing makes it come off as less raw, more processed, less *trustworthy* than a nigh-inscrutable ee-cummings-style tone poem primal scream where the syntax melts, the words go Humpty-Dumpty, and irony comes and goes as it pleases.
