# An Atheist, a Rape Victim, a Rabbi, and a Priest Walk Into a Church on 9/11

This is a "joke" I tell in [my act][]

[my act]: ad21c8c2-36f5-446b-9ddd-19d633cb6b60.md

## The Atheist

"Living victims"? Uh, they're called SURVIVORS.

## The next person

No such thing as living victims? I AM ONE.

## The Rabbi

They are saying it was intentional, that it was terrorism. I believe that. The men of the Middle East, for that region, I don't know that the Shoah ever truly ended. But, what I know from the survivors, they had one weapon: shock. If you knew you were going to die, you would use your death to shock. And I believe that is probably what these men today felt. And today, the Shoah has made victims of them as well.

Misha, today, you would have been a victim. I just pray to God that you live long enough to realize what you have survived.

No, actually, that might make sense, but what he actually said was *that* you have survived. I mean, for the purposes of this fake joke I made up. "I don't get it, what are you saying, are we supposed to believe you, or what?" You're supposed to think about it. And what exactly it means to believe.

## The Priest

I think he was wrong. People thought Christ a victim

## The one true thing

People always want the last word.

## Why it's fucking fake

What the priest said next, passing the collection basket at a church *he doesn't even go to*:

It showed that it was such an empty, hollow, self-serving, performance piece - not that it happened, I mean, you know, this was fake, just, you know, imaginary

For thoughts on the Crucifixion, we proceed to the [Well of Souls][]
