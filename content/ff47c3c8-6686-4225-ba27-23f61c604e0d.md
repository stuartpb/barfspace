# Barfspace Roll of Loose Notes

I'm going to try using this instead of Google Keep for a while.

---

heading ids that aren't numbers would also make sense as tooltip values, as a markdown rendering option

---

blackbeard's treasure public/private/secret three-layer personal disclosure classification model?

heck even just describing what a Blackbeard's Treasure gambit is would be cool

---

a thing I think about a lot is Chris Morris describing his career trajectory going from The Day Today to Four Lions being that he used to be really engrossed in the way people said things, and then he became engrossed in what was being said. I'm paraphrasing somewhat, but the way thematuration was framed really shifted somethign for me. this should probably be torn off and put somewhere in the vicinity of that "growing Up" / "The Delats" angst-musing or whatever

END OF ROLL, PLEASE RE-ORDER
