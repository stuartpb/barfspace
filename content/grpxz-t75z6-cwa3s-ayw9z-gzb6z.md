# Mutant Labs of History

thoughts after seeing https://dynamicland.org/

- PARC (Smalltalk, desktops)
- MIT AI Lab (ITS that birthed EMACS, home of the Jargon File iirc)
- MIT TMRC (TX0, which was, like, the first non-military electronic computer)
- Stanford AI Lab (Mother of All Demos: first mouse, first hypertext)
- Bell Labs (first voice synthesis,)

The Jargon File and Hackers (Steven Levy's book) are two more sources to cite here

(put me in by Primer Prime)
