# Voyager Pro Scatter File

Rebooting into recovery (via the button in MTK Droid Tool, though I probably could have done it via adb on stushiba had I thought to try it) lets me look at /cache/recovery/last_log via "View recovery logs", where the list of buildprops(? stuff like ro.product.manufacturer, which is listed as "Alco", contra the ro.product.brand which is RCA) is followed by stuff like "Opening update package...", and then this after "Update package verification took 0.5 s" - I'm copying this by hand:

note that the sizes of some of these partitions are also listed at [output from fastboot getinfo all](65abc453-7c1e-43ce-9594-a1183423b7b9.md), to save you some math

I'm realizing now that this is, ironically, probably in the system image I dumped - not just as metadata, but this log itself (NOTE: it's GPT-formatted, so yes)

Going on to [manipulating the dumps on stushiba](8ba3972c-ab5d-4724-ae52-c6ec001b48ac.md)
