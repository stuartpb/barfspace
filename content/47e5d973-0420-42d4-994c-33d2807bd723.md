# stushiba early july dev stuff

ran a big ol' `sudo pacman -Syu`, then rebooted

I want to get minikube running so I can start putting together a cluster for my workspaces, and minikube apparently has a local volume provisioner like I've been thinking there should be

I'm also thinking I should install webext so I can hack on Firefox extensions but I set up the groundwork to do that when I installed the ESP stuff a while back
