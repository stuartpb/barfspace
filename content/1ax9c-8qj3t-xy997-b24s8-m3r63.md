# stuvern

This machine describes an Arch Linux Droplet on DigitalOcean, back when they had Arch as an option.

This droplet is not currently running, although the image for it (if I recall correctly) is still on my account, if ever I wanted to resurrect it.

## Changelog

There is one changelog, dated [2013-09-06](8hpse-kxvtf-ae9pn-ccaqq-4wgcg) in its commit/creation history.
