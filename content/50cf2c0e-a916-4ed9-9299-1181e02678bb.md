# teaching cover letter

I love to demystify, and am eager to level the field in making a wider base of people able to realize their ideas and potential

I love to learn, to give the most comprehensive and correct answers that I can, and love to espress the limits of my own knowledge and highlight the expertise of others around me

I'm always looking for different ways to approach things
