# All the Old Stubernetes Iterations

- [Studtop Mark I](kbryw-6dc19-r18n7-6pg5d-4aqwf)
  - first single-node attempt
  - k3os, installed directly to a Chromebook's 16GB onboard storage
  - Longhorn attempted for use as attached storage
  - Fell apart due to running out of image space, naturally (regardless of Longhorn support)
  - Had an abortive attempt to reinstall to a 64GB USB stick that was called "Studtop Mk II" for a bit
    - as I would come to realize, this USB stick is far too slow for OS operation
- [Initial post-k3os plan](fqj27-pjkze-cxbtv-2szde-g0gc3)
  - see also [Rebuilding Plans](ksm42-1xpwv-rn9ag-a1vdt-cswcw)
  - when I first had the idea to [flash the installation media to onboard storage](jwcha-677x6-mn9jr-k9pyv-3k7wv)
    - though this iteration was intended to be multiple-install-media-oriented
  - this is where I settled on Kubic-on-bare-metal
  - covers some of the other ideas that were considered
    - like a hypervisor using images from attached storage
- [Abortive Kubic Install to PNY Elite-X](7td1z-nbsr1-febya-dzzef-dd804)
  - I believe it's around here that I realized a MicroSD card would be cheap and fast enough
- [First Earnest Kubic Runthrough](apqev-my4ak-mzbtq-09rsa-dcac5)
  - this is what most "Studtop Mark II" references would be describing
    - it ends up being rebuilt and redesigned quickly enough that that label, itself, starts to blur
    - by the time the plan settles on a system design that wouldn't fail in setup, the name "studtop" was no longer part of it
      - this machine would go on to be renamed "stumethyst" in [the initial Kluster iteration](xx8te-328fx-r680r-ck2np-wggbz)
        - ultimately, this was renamed "stunster" and removed from service shortly after

    - [Trying to get OpenEBS Working](9p2xt-m51z4-abbqy-zxs5g-5x24d)
      - this is where everything comes to a screeching halt (the cluster got Cronenberged)

- somewhere around here is the last time these notes were relevant:
  - [Quick Access Commands/Links](hdh89-1mqmh-0safa-wcvr6-7ptts)
    - describes how to open tunnels / port-forwards to access various internal dashboards
    - these days, the only services referenced here that are still in-cluster have Ingress routes

- The legacy of trying to bring it back:
  - [a walkthrough trying to retrace my steps](b3ntz-v91vx-pt9ry-qzj7t-hy1rr) (2020-06-17)
    - After looking at this, I realize it would be a lot easier to just recreate the chart installations as local documents
      - Like, why run Kubernetes if you're just gonna do all this stuff like the system can't be revived
    - aborted in favor of Helm-based preconfiguration
