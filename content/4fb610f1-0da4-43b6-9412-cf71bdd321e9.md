- Add microcode updates for AMD
- How hard can I make rEFInd be the default boot option? Can I clobber the default location without breaking Windows boot?
- the GNOME Screen Keyboard is *hella broken* (should check how it looks on stuzzy)
- What's with the Deepin greeter? Didn't I set my default greeter to be GTK? Do I need to uninstall Deepin?
