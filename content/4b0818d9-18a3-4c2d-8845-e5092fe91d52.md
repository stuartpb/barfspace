# Projects Off the Conventional Web Stack

Most of my extensions are designed to be used somewhere between the backend of a web server and the frontend of a web browser.

Here are some projects that would be software, but *not* stuff that fits neatly into the Web Platform.

For how everything else fits into the Web Stack, see [this alternative project page index](d93f66b1-427e-4978-8ac7-14fb452bfad6.md).
