# Quests

This page hosted the first real explosion of content in these notes.

[the Quests Style Guide page](2fzkf-4f2as-2v9px-kcw6j-s9hw8) is still around to reflect the guiding principles of this Quest design.

Its function has been made largely redundant by pages off the [Projects](gm4xd-ehwvm-ca85t-mmsg2-4ptqf) page, as well as the meta structures for these notes

Its real legacy, though, was in the "list as thought tree" style which has made a resurgence as of mid-2019.
