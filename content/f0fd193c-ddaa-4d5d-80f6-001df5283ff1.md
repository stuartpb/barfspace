You've got this whole crazy system for structuring content, and you're using it like crazy, but you still haven't explained the *why* of this system to anybody, the *what* or the *how*.

- [ ] Don't forget about [How I'm Writing With Bagtent][]
- [ ] Link or merge this into [BISNES][]
- [ ] Write up an explainer on bagtent (ie. finish README)
- [ ] Identify strengths and weakness (ie. When It Might Make Sense to Use Bagtent)
- [ ] See if anybody would be interested in being a producer for bagtent (a la the [Network Neighborhood quest for "Requests for Producers"][NNQ]
- [ ] Think about a logo or artwork for bagtent.
  - [ ] Look through your Tabalanche stash to see if you can find that picture of a failed 3d print where some of the pieces were partway printed, it was cool, and a good mood-board inspirational aesthetic for all this.

They tend to have a characteristic simplicity that's reflected upon in [My Old Bad Ideas][]

- [ ] [Global Issue Reports for Everything][tracker]
- [ ] I had an idea to do this "oral tradition" thing where I'd try to re-type the same story several times from memory to, basically, break my compulsive fear of repeating myself, and also to see, you know, what I can glean about how it affects me (Mindfulness thing).
