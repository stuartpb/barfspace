# the ooze

(originally leaked out from [these thoughts on the top-links sprouting model](64wps-e4bbs-2k92x-60dc5-v1afd) for [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3))

these notes are like the raw version of what my programs look like, like this is the primordial ooze, the egg whites of what I do: it's just a bunch of random thoughts that dictate the program's behavior, but there's no attempt to structure them - they define a consistent whole, but it's like getting snapshots of different parts of an elephant. Programming is the act of putting all those parts together.
