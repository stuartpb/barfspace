# getting in to grafana

running `kubectl get -n prometheus secret kube-prometheus-stack-grafana -o go-template='{{index .data "admin-password" | base64decode}}' && echo` to see that the password is "prom-operator", instead of the random password [that would normally be generated by default](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/8ccc79bcfae769d037c4d8aa4318aa13d83203cf/charts/grafana/templates/secret.yaml#L16)

I remember seeing this at one point

Ohh, this probably would have been mentioned in the notes for the release...
