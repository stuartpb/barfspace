## Reshaping Security

This is an arc of [Quests][] to rework the way we conceptualize security in technology into something that actually works and makes sense for human beings.

This is a big initiative for me, spanning many different projects, so forgive me if this page seems a little... scanty. Believe me, there's a lot more that's supposed to go here that you're just not seeing yet.
