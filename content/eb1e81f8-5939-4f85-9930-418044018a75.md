# Department of Barfspace

The Department of Barfspace is the district of notes concerned with introspecting the structure of the notes, and acting on that introspection by reshaping to fit. (This is a constant dance we do.)

Put another way: this is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way, as well as a collection of notes reflecting on patterns that have cropped up (especially through History Force)

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo][OBR].

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests](6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md) was eventually divided up into three "domains" which have grown into their own separate entities:

## Operations

These were the quests dealing with revisions to the content of these notes: legacies, maintenance, upkeep, migration, things like that.

This has come to become the main focus of the Department of Barfspace: the page for these Operations now lists [subdivisions](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md) carrying out these duties.

### Unassigned operation work

The Bagtent page is halfway to becoming the University of Bagtent, which can list out to several more more-specific-in-scope bagtent indices (some of which are shared with the Academy and/or the Worse is Better Index)

## Visions

The Visions page dealt with quests about explaining structure, coming up with new things to try, reflecting on the philosophy guiding this notes work, stuff like that.

That page has graduated into becoming the [Academy of Barfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md).

## Implementation Operations Adjunct

For notes around the implementation of the notes, see the [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) note nexus, managed by The [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md), an affiliate agency to the Department of Barfspace that paves the way for and informs a lot of content work, but isn't a true content agency like these (meaning it's not working in Barfspace).
