my original plan with this was to just have a workspace where I'd keep a bunch of files and never commit them to Git or push them to GitHub

I ended up adding the thing that autocommits and pushes because a) I actually do like version history, and b) I like having my content pushed to GitHub

what I had a problem with was trying to make things fit into neat commits. originally I was thinking "oh, sure, I could just do it like a work-in-progress branch", but that still had the problem where I'd put off making commits

and then I was like "what if I made it commit every time I save the buffer" but then it's like "okay, so now instead of being afraid to commit, I'm afraid of saving the buffer"

so now I've got this kind of hybrid setup where the text editor autosaves and then it only commits if I either hesitate or get really into something

which kind of makes sense
