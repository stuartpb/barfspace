# my as-yet-unnamed octopi system

## name brainstorming

I'm thinking about something that could pair with "stuflair" - I thought of "sturic", but that looks weird and also Ric Flair seems like he might be kind of an asshole

  - the [bounding box](https://github.com/foosel/OctoPrint/issues/1551) was not set in Prusa's default image, this should probably be reported upstream
    - it's weird that this wasn't a suggestion in the notification, but disabling the check was
    - moreover, this is a weird feature to include at this point in the process - my slicer does bound checking for me
      - I guess I could be downloading gcode off the internet that was made for a bigger printer, like maybe a calibration procedure by mistake?
  - installing the Cancel Objects plugin before I start print a plate of [beads for my necklace](369c67c5-e608-4dcd-9f61-0cb357e6350e.md)
    - ah crap, it doesn't treat instances as objects
    - it's retracing the _entire bed_ before  each layer of the first object. That seems like a behavior that could be improved.

## musing

what if the next i3 mark doesn't even include an LCD, it's entirely oriented for RPi and touchscreen? That or it'll use whatever the SL1 uses

IDK, that'd jack up the price by like 20 bucks unnecessarily - the whole point of these components in the base kit is that they're cheap
