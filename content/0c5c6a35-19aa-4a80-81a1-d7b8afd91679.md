# Nuclear Tic Tac Toe

## Mechanics

I'm thinking one interesting twist on this might be to have it so, on your turn, you can opt to rotate a plane like a Rubik's Cube

Or maybe you have to rotate every turn, you just pick whether you want to place-then-rotate or rotate-then-place

There'd be a "no backsies" rule to rotation where you can't just undo the previous rotation

## Interview questions

I've been thinking this game would make for some good tech interview material, an improvement on the old "implement tic-tac-toe for me" exercise.

- Implement a function that takes a board state and returns the final score.
- Implement a function that rotates one plane.
- How many possible final board states are there?
- How many rotation-independent possible games are there?
