# 5D Chess Elephant

This would be a modification of the Queen in 5D Chess: whenever you get to the end, a Pawn doesn't become a Queen: they also get the freedom of movement of a Knight

I believe this mirrors the Elephant of Chess 2?

Anyway, this would remove the situational disadvantage of not getting the upgrade choice
