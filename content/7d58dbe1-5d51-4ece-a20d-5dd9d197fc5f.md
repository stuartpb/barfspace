# A really quick proof of the halting problem

Like, here's how I understand it.

Let's say you had a branch in your loop that uses the quadration formula, and it's on a condition like "if the last digit of an equation that is only solvable in three times the lifetime of the universe is a three, then exit the loop", you can only know if the loop's going to loop forever after a billion years

though I suppose you could convince the compiler to trust that theorem... but what if it can't be sure if it applies?
