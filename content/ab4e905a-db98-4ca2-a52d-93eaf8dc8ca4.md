# Project HOARD

This is my ongoing experiment for Human-Oriented Asset Retrieval and Deposition - a way of tidying all my stuff without having to get rid of useful things. Essentially I'm kind of looking to build my own

Previously hoard-guidelines, originally in its own repo (created 2016-11-28 though I know I was working on the project at least a couple weeks earlier, if not months). See [the postmortem][] for what went wrong, and what I'm trying now.

this page will be for aggregating the branches of phase 2 (informally, the new vision: "bagtent of things"), like what my procedures are, what my observations have been, thoughts on the new software, etc

## key point

The whiteboards are like the staging area: they're for holding until it can be typed out.

Another thing to notice is that keeping all the data digitally means I never run out of space to describe everything in the bin to an adequate level of detail - I had some bins that became "full" not because they actually *were*, but because the *front* couldn't hold more labels.
