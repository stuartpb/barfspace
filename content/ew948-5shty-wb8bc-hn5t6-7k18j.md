# Notespace on Stubernetes Mark II

This is a remake of [the Iteration-1 Notestack Household Workspace](cy160-n7d4r-g681j-axcxz-6n35t) after The Cataclysm, on the Mark 2 Studtop (the one the actual cluster is going to be patterned after, Eris willing.)

As of 2020-06-14, it is held up on changes being made to the system to support persistent volumes, DNS, and potentially even Oauth / certification proxies
