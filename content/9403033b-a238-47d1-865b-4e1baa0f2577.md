# Learning Journeys

Notes I make as I explore various technologies.

Kind of dovetails with [Lean Notes][], in a way, though Lean Notes tends to slice by aspect, and this tends to slice by technology (though I expect those lines to blur going forward).

## Software-type study

These are all studies of protocols, libraries, interfaces, techniques, things like that

Much like the different categories of Project, they're not mutually exclusive, but usually point to adjacent categories instead of sharing links

- [Close to the Kernel](aab8f713-cba7-457c-aa4c-f77c00f5ef99.md)
  - relatively speaking
- [Three-Dimensional Space](99e3281d-db72-429b-a6c2-9aea173d1db7.md)
- [Browsers, Node, and the Internet](18121112-bde0-4717-a221-d4f4b38155fd.md)
- [Softdev Miscellanea](e4f7fc4a-7242-45e0-8631-7586727fa1e9.md)
  - right now the common theme is Encodings and Esoteric Languages

These pages have Journal sections as part of a larger exploration (which may also be linked from notes above):

- [Structures and Design](8642721a-f8a5-41c3-a21c-dba6decb200a.md)
- [Decentralization and Federation](c47c2afa-59e0-4cde-a5b5-6afe4509ac46.md)
- [Let's Encrypt nexus](4ea48809-1a9d-42b6-aebc-22902d831c24.md)

## Other kinds of note

[Data and Reference Sheets](3823093b-64d3-43f8-ab26-853d39123d90.md) tracks various pieces of information that I've collected (or found).

[Maker Journeys](cd84567a-5cb9-43e8-85b0-bfe39960655a.md) explores more "hard" technology (like plastic and steel).

## Possible ways for this page to evolve

It might make sense to have this devolve into a page linking off to more subject-oriented pages, where I have a "Journals-like section" for pages where Log links and understandings Journals-style. (This is happening now, kind of - we'll see how "sectional" the Journal sections get, and I'm not sure I'm breaking at the right level at the moment. Might need to get more subject-and-tavern-y: maybe just as the number of researched topics gets further bigger.)

There can also be an Academy-of-Barfspace-owned page exploring the Journals structure, like the one exploring Quests.
