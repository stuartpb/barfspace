# Parts I'd Like to Print for my 3D Printer

like [the Quests Page](0b49c0ed-b327-4005-879e-59762d3af2b5.md), but for models I already have

many of these were found by just browsing "popular" prints on prusaprinters.org

## ultimate quest, requires vitamins

    - give me this, but with holes to service the screws
  - https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/2365-prusa-i3-mk3s-noctua-extruder-fan-cover
    - needs longer screws, but ones that'd be available spare

    - heh
- better print cooling:

- better reliability / overall whatever
  - https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/3676-mmu2s-extruder-mod-feeds-almost-any-tip-no-jams-fo
- maybe a better idler door
