# Linting the Prose

Note that this dovetails with the "conventions for taking shorter and shorter notes that I need tooling to go back and detangle" jam in [this jive turkey](rp20g-pdq0s-wg8m5-0aw03-fj80t)

- [ ] You know a tool I could really use? One that can detect when I've got a runon sentence left dangling.
  - https://textlint.github.io/ is prior art - it links out to some more in-depth stylistic proofreaders
  - It'd be funny if the thing that gets me to fully fall down on the side of punctuation for style, as I mused about in at least one Meta Collection post, would be that ending sentences with punctuation
  - [ ] Think about a format to denote "I can't write it all out right now but here's a few words that'll definitely fit in
    - [ ] See if this might make sense in some kind of context in the Alphabi-like encoder described below.
    - [ ] A linter that just catches... places where I've left these caret-jump-markers without a jog-your-memory bit (so, like, a grep invocation) would probably be enough to ease, like, 90% of the anxiety I have over incomplete commits
    - [ ] some way of auto-adding "I don't think you got where you're going" markers, or some analytics on my behavior when writing, might give some insight / help here
    - [ ] If this becomes a common convention it'd definitely become a thing we have to mention in the barfspace style guide / welcome wagon or whatever thing explains what all the weird local colloquialisms and jargon and whatever is. it'd also have to be like a hip trendy listening post registry bulletin about the latest slang, too? eh this is kind of into the weeds
  - Maybe if we ever introduce YAML frontmatter, opting into various prose checks can be one of its primary functions?
