# Some ideas for Bellarianism

## Bell's Whistles

Bell's Whistles are the things Bellarians give out freely, like Samaritan tokens. They're tuned to 2600 Hertz, the Holy Frequency, and they've got the Bell logo where Jo Prusa's initials go on Jo's whistle design.

## A Holy Text with Bells On

"With Bells On" is a thing in Bellarianism, for when you mean something very, very deeply, but you also understand why the limitations of the religion stop you from doing it, and so you want to make it clear that you're not trying to mock anybody.

For example, Rebecca Meyer is a Saint Second Class With Bells On, because her story is so, so tragic, but if you just tell it straight to somebody who just discovered that "rebeccapurple" is a valid color, they'll probably think you're making it up.
