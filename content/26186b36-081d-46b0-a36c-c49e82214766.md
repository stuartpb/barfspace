# Emergent patterns in Lean Notes

## Title and Subject

Many chapter/section titles are of the form "X and Y", because one word can be interpreted a number of different ways: a second word draws a line toward the intended interpretation and widens the scope a bit.

For example: "Security and Preparedness" explains that, in terms of Security, what the section aims for is post-facto security, and security against things that aren't intruders: in short, Preparedness (but preparedness for things going wrong, and not just scaling up).
