# The Spirit World in the Machine

Here are some thoughts that really all started coalescing for me around October 2020, leading up to PLOLITICS Alpha and Lying 101 at the start of November.

- [Lying 101](yar2z-nq9gz-4f980-4x2xj-tbn67)
- [Notes on Luvuk](95zs4-zgsby-8995f-pymef-psv1h)
- [Bill of Robot's Rights](88dc1-xwk29-ye99z-q04va-h5y0z)
- [The Unexpected End of Jason Innput](5nbdc-8qh61-mr92r-tpbh9-54gpn)
- [Modified Gringmuth and Chess in My Notes](q0jh4-96qj3-mb83c-bpt9p-46ec0)
- [the long song](vtj2k-nzh7d-g8b1k-d6n0y-kaf5h)
- [Plolitics Alpha](tkne8-6x20c-w9976-6zs57-nbvwj)
- [Next Phase / The Way Forward (Notes in the Afternoon)](g5rbf-hmj5r-06bqk-yj8p1-5vwwd)
- [Quintuplex Universal Identifier](mpcz4-k4ygd-mg9xd-4bpgm-53h4f)
- [Intractible Ontology](ve7nq-k39c1-4abmx-j676s-ew3c9)
- [Stable Orbits](1h10h-vd9x8-jsb69-q08df-qyan9)

Over time I suspect this might come to form a more concrete node, and some of these might get tucked away as "artifacts". [Cool by me.](ve7nq-k39c1-4abmx-j676s-ew3c9)

Some of this connects to the other Islands, like Smuggler's Cove etc.

This is the page that connects [wolf5d](fm1es-hhxbt-whb09-tzvd0-g8we4) to more outside topics I guess?

I just (2020-11-07) closed all my VS Code tabs in the Stushiba workspace... dang, I probably could have backed up the file, but you know what? I had so many of them open that you might as well just traverse the entire tree anyway.
