# my pocketchip keyface

2020-05-12: Printed the new design idea I had for highlighting the F keys, and honestly... it's not that great.

Not only does the yellow not show up well against the black plastic at small sizes, the big spot doesn't look cool like I thought it would. It just looks ugly, and turns the cute-yellow-thing into a thing-with-a-gaping-void-on-its-face

thinking I'll just redo it black-on-yellow, even though that doesn't match the Fn key

I don't know, maybe it'll grow on me.

## redoing the Fn Zone

Might redo Fn with a circular outline instead? Maybe even an outline on the casing?

I think the "circular outline" idea is solid, and easy enough to do - just difference a positive delta of it from a negative.

As for the F keys, I'm honestly thinking I'll just have them all swarmed with (slightly smaller than the leftmost) "F"s next to them, and then expand the "F10", "F11", and "F12" bits go inside the (maaaybe second-outlined) 10, 11, and 12 notes

maybe F10 is represented with a super-super-scripted F and a closer-on-the-diagonal 1

F11 and F12 might be "word-balooned" with skinny necks

After giving it a day, the "borg plate" look is proving to be morre than just ugly: it's confusing! I started pressing the Function keys

## D-pad cutout thoughts

Dpad's a bit disappointing, too: I'm actually thinking what'd be least uncomfortable would be to make each direction have the same circle-bezel as the other keys
