# The Sweet Spot of Absurdity

The other day, talking about what I don't like about so much of government and management, I hit the zeitgeist of what bothers me right on the head:

I can't stand management that **refuses to accept absurd realities**.

So, like, for example, I've been working on this OPWS project, and there are two ways I could see some other idiot fucking this up.

One would be rejecting profile data like `password.reset.flow.submit.expire: unchanged`, meaning that you're allowed to use the same reset token multiple times, because "that would be absurd". Well, you're not wrong buddy, but guess what? There are multiple sites out there where **that is how their reset tokens actually work**.

Or, like, the guy on Reddit who was saying "Any site that's hashing on the server is in gross dereliction of best practices, regardless of whether they're passing the password through TLS." Look, server-side hashing is ridiculous, but it is **the only way to do it**, bar some *extremely* intricate and fragile Javascript solutions that nobody does (except maybe Mega).

*These fuckin' guys.* The ones who balked at the idea of Donald Trump getting elected as President, simply because it was *too absurd*. As if there is some soft of mystical force intervening in the laws of physics that *gives a shit*.

Anyway, this isn't exactly new, it's the same kind of concept that existentialists reckoned with in the aftermath of the Holocaust.

The flip side of this that I can't stand is when *nobody takes anything seriously*, seeing Dadaism as an ends in and of itself, rather than a means of understand how things *can be made* to make sense.
