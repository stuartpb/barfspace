## Rules and Nature

### Avoid rules

Non-emergent rules imposing behavior on people, imposed and enforced by people, creates tension between people.

Emergent rules from an abstract design, that influence people's behavior, don't create tension and uncertainty.

### Avoid problems

When you find people doing something that's a problem for you, look into making it not a problem before considering how you can stop people from doing it.

## Seeding

Start small: when your success depends on having a good community, make sure that the people who are first in your community are a smaller version of what you'd like your community to grow into.

Don't worry about your small stuff not making sense if you get bigger. See this essay by Paul Graham: [Do Things that Don't Scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)

## Curation and Freedom

Pick your limits: every site is legally going to be obligated to control its content to some extent. You need to choose up front how much you're going to control.
