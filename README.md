# barfspace

This is a repository of works-in-progress and other not-ready-for-primetime writing that I do. I had previously kept a few of these as uncomitted files in my workspace for [stuartpb/meditations][] (not comitting them because I felt they weren't finished enough to publish), but eventually decided I'd rather maintain them in a perpetual work-in-progress repository.

[stuartpb/meditations]: https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations

## Files

By their original filename (before they were all given UUIDs to alleviate the pressure of having to name files), soon to be migrated into loose collections:

There was also a [scrapyard][] file that was meant to stand out from the rest of these.

There is already one collection that contains more than the list above: [the barfspace meta collection][meta], containing files that were originally kept separate in a directory called "docs".
