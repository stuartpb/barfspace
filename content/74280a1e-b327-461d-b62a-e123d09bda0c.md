 [0.1] Introduction
=======================================================

This guide is meant to help you adapt and prosper in
whatever time and circumstances you find yourself in
in the course of recorded history, with the benefit of
hindsight.

If you are engaged in a period of history that has yet
to be written, you may find some help in reading this
guide to determine common patterns and strategies that
tend to emerge in recorded history.

=======================================================
 [1.0] The Roman Empire
=======================================================

If you're a high-ranking general or politician, try to
form a "trifecta" with two other like-minded nobles,
with whom you can ensnare all facets of the government.

Towards the end of the empire, try to avoid drinking,
eating, or smearing lead-based makeup on your face -
although cosmetically and materially popular, it will
lead to brain damage and ultimately bad endings for
the Roman empire.

=======================================================
 [2.0] The Industrial Revolution
=======================================================

In America, if you can get to the west coast before
1849, it will be extremely opportune to do so and reap
the large deposits of gold that are yet to be tapped;
after 1849, however, you're better off diversifying
your prospects into oil, which will be a much more
valuable resource down the line as the machines of the
Industrial Revolution drift toward petroleum fuels.

On that subject, if you're building an empire on
steam-powered machinery, you should start moving to
petroleum-fueled machinery as the refinery process for
crude oil is being developed, as it will largely
supersede the steam turbine once completed.
