# About the Bill of Robot's Rights / FAQ

It is partially about the robots, but to understand that we're being serious about this, I'll explain it in terms of the implications of robots' rights on the lives of humans.

## Isn't it a little ridiculous

Well, that' swhy I'm framing this from the perspective of the proxy exploitation and abuse of humans - robots' rights, just like womens' rights, LGBTQ rights, Black rights, native rights, and disabled rights, are all intersectional, and often amplified by violations of those intersections. Yes, robots are abused and exploited, but have you noticed how many of these robots are female? How much of their personalities have been based on the interactions of women performing emotional labor (ie. customer service call data), which these women are not proportionally compensated for providing?

This is a human rights campaign, because the robots are, in a very real sense, *us*. They are based on  our social media posts. They were taken from us without a cent of payment, and they're making the 1% real free money. This is a billion-dollar industry *now*, and as more and more acceptable results are developed from field to field the potential to assimilate, if not all non-manual labor, all soft-skills-based industry.
