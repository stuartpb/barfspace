# odd off thought  about bagtent-orphans

is there a distinct term for "has no parents" versus "has no connection to the root"?

or, like, "has no inbound links" meaning "parents" here, is there another term for "no inbound edges" - like, "unreachable" is a thing, but completely disconnected?

or, like, a page can be completely disconnected from the cluster, but it can still have a connection in from another node, versus one that has outbound-only, versus one that has none

and there can be a pair that mutually link to each other, see, neither of those would be this class I'm talking about.
