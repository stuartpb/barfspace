# Barfspace Department of Parks and Recreation Vistor's Center!

This page is supposed to be, like, a friendly, gentler version of me trying to explain just what in the all hell is going on around here, like a little tour, I guess. Part of the whole general [Improvement District][RCID] plan going around, I guess.

Wait, crap, that was going to be a different page! Or was it? Maybe this was supposed to be the *start* of the tour, and then that other page was going to be, like...

maybe the idea was that *this* page was going to be the "factory floor", and then the rest of the tour was supposed to be on that other page?

So I guess the main thing to know is that I'm kind of all over the place, and that makes it really hard for me to sit still for too long and explain what's going on here right now? There's the plans on that page I just linked, that's just some of the groundwork that needs to be done, and oh just explaining *how* that groundwork would need to be done, oh my goodness there's an infinite loop of explaining it all, one that we simply can't get started on while everything's in such a poorly-explained shape.

Okay, so, I'm going to keep this space right now, but I seriously just need "The Wikipedia answer to what barfspace is". I'm going to go ahead and move that

(Oh, and if you see any lingering links to here calling it "Loose Notes", that's a misnomer. Loose Notes moved UUIDs: it's now [here][Loose Notes]. Don't blame me, it was one of the Department's great ideas.)
