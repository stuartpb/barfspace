# A DCIM for Printers / Filaments

I humbly suggest that SD cards are cheap enough that every filament vendor should pack one in with every spool, and then that card can be used as an identifier for the spool

(TODO: write up the draft BoM etc for this idea)

Anyway, at its base you'd just have manufacturer, color name, material, suggested temperature range, othr slic3r metrics like density, a link to where to buy it?

and then you could get fancy with Prusament-level metrics

## also

you'd want an intercompatible ["odometer format"](acca831d-b6eb-4d16-a951-a6f5670ec479.md) for Printacle to interoperate with other applications somehow

also you want some format where it makes sense that this'd be on a shared card that's plugged into the printer, like maybe something the firmware itself could track and export per run? just a thought
