# the kind of game the economy should be

Like, I feel like one of the fundamental lies of Trumpism's imagined world is that players are of vastly different quality, but all games are more or less equal. hence the constant need to win at *everything* (like the Kim Jongs) - any weakness means you're not Winner Prime.

it's like a fighting game where there's one move to win every time, and it's "screw everyone and be born rich"

anyway, my thinking here takes a tack along the lines of a thread that gets brought up in David Sirlin's "Playing to Win": if your game is dominated by one strategy, that's the game now, and if that strategy is boring, well, then it's a dumb game

but if you pretend it's not the game... Playing to Win has this whole thing I can't get into about being a scrub that's kind of a tangent to what I'm going with here

which is that it's valid to go "oh hey, this game sucks, we should be playing a game with different rules"
