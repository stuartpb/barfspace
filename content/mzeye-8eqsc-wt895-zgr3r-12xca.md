# Cults and Comedies

Whoops, just did a `find content -type f -empty` and it looks like I never got aronud to writing this!

Anyway, this might have been a messay on how They Take Away Your Laugh in cults?

Some of this stuff should maybe start bridging back into messays, maybe putting this into the Comedy Moleskine under a couple levels and having the not-integral-to-the-core-pieces stuff moved out to there as well
