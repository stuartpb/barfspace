# Jason Arrives at Camp Kristallsee

Jason describes the things that have troubled him:

- The pages are a mess
  - They don't seem to be in any kind of coherent order
    - This is somewhat self-explanatory, as like very five pages are either stapled, or paperclipped, or muddy, and they seem to have been collected, compiled, and handed over in a hurry
      - they're all from this region
