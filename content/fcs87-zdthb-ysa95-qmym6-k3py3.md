# Project Hoard 2K19

(If HOARD is going to be the overall project that includes stuff like the Packing Procedure, then maybe this should get a new subname, like "Bintent", with a new legacy node for "Pre Bintent 2016-2018 Experiment and Results")

To make: an "All That Junk That's In my Trunks" note, listing the stuff in my bins in more detail

this is the REAL heir to the intended use of boxesin, fwiw - the borkflowy "accordion interface" is pretty much just what the other half'd be

## thoughts on physical tags linking into these notes

I'm thinking I'll print out Data Matrix codes...

I almost said "for these notes' UUIDs", because that'd let the labels be like hyperlinks...

Actually... I might include that as a feature in the whiteboard iteration as a use for the removable yellow label paper!

Still needs recognition -> link support.

I don't know if I've written this down, but I'm thinking the UUIDs will work just like the QR codes were going to, but without as much of an emphasis on recognizing other stuff on the bin

but so yeah, then what you'd do is you'd keep these UUIDs in notes, and you'd include the UUID in your note as a sentinel that it refers to the contents of that bin - maybe a special form like a line matching "^Tag: (UUID goes here)$" to get priority (others would be treated like hyperlinks to a page that exists in meatspace and not bagspace, searchable only to find what parents and theme indices are referencing you - not that I honestly expect to copy an asset tag's UUID to pages not expressly for it)

contents can be described in boxes

but so yeah that's a thing, the white DataMatrix labels (which I'm thinking might be printed "bigwise" and placed on the entire sidebar) would be permanent (so they'd stick on the side edge), so they'd want to refer ro a "separate asset" (so the "taggedness" relation to this label can jump nodes like any other content, in case other pages link to that page for a purpose irrelevant to its original function)

Note that that semantic shift of entities is a key component to the CBGBism messay, it should be linked in
