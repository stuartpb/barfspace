# Weird Stubs

This is a fun little zone collecting all the pages that *maybe* have a purpose? Like, they have the seed of an idea that's unique, even if their *in practice* purpose has all leaked out.

This should maybe become a [Department of Barfspace](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md) division, The Weird Stub Care Center

This could also be treated as "these pages aren't orphans, but they might as well be, for how far out in the sticks they are relative to where they should be"

- [the former Toolchain Quests page](0031208d-0493-4dcf-9d70-6dbf1daaa52c.md)
- [Desktop Quests](445ae6d8-5796-43b7-8648-704c8ebb9e18.md) has gone kind of underloved
- I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note that were tacked onto Operation Trapper Keeper and now live [here](2e874825-eb8d-4b42-9c31-dfcf4f30a799.md), those ought to move, maybe rejoin Unusual Studio Quests, maybe as a subpage (should USQ become an Unusual Studio Notes Hub, which can link out to the Unusual Studio Kind Of consultancy hub?)
- [this page](a7dde721-d7cb-437a-8497-f0c0f011756a.md) under The Unconvincing Truth lists a plan to reintegrate it, but I'm not sure where that place would be
- [this page on Random UUIDs](25d7f993-c280-4075-87cb-535c51102b26.md) (or a subpage sprouted from it) could fit in a few Method Lab places as well as Lean Notes
- [this note on a logic puzzle](6c383b1d-bea5-4652-a1f0-9d207b47461b.md) was a tendril off from the Stuff I Have Read linkdump, but it raises an interesting idea for reframing logic puzzles in a less-contrived narrative fashion
- [an idea for a copylefted mindfulness resource](e8817b38-0c9e-406e-a9f2-923b869dba94.md) doesn't have a good place to sit in projects for now

## Hypothetical Weird Stubs

This is my "pages I'd write if I weren't busy right now" hangout for the moment (for uncategorizable pages that'd mainly live under The Rest) - it might go somewhere else, but this page is a suitable headspace for it right now

- Future Memorials: I feel like I should have a page for things that exist, but in the future, nobody will believe it was possible, because life is terrible and everything fades
  - Trader Sam's Grog Grotto was where I coined the phrase "this is gonna become a place that used to be great some day"
  - getyarn.io has no feasible business model, but it's fantastic and in a sane world would flourish
