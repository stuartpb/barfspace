# Pitches and Scripts

This is an index page for various creative-writing-type pieces I write: story premises, character study, dialogue bits, stuff like that.

They're usually not that thoroughly developed because they're, you know, exercises. But the pieces might be usable for other things.

I've split this page in two:

- ["Original" premises](a8a866de-058d-4729-86f0-57088d744e28.md)
  - like one-off loglines for sketches
- ["Derivative" work](bf409581-d752-437a-a086-60002a0f6889.md)
  - like spec scripts for TV shows

On the entirely superficial difference between the two: [On Fanfiction](bd72f20b-397c-4908-9112-1a86e073c492.md)

This page could serve as a Tavern for ideas that don't cleanly fall between the new halves if needed

[The Spirit World in the Machine](8558bb98-b9ff-4164-906f-feee17311f4b.md) is a bit derivative, a bit "original", and a bit *all too fucking real*.

## Detritus

Here's [a page with lots of little exchanges apropos of nothing that might go somewhere, IDK](46859426-4cd3-42b5-8b16-63d65fba20b8.md)
