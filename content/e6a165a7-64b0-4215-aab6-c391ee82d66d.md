# Fun with proquints

It's embarassing, you'd think I'd already be well-versed in these, but I only kind of knew them obliquely (like, I think JSBin uses this), and only found this in the README for [the first GitHub result](https://github.com/richfitz/ids) when Googling "random identifiers".

leads to [this fantasy idea](bbe3dbf8-85f3-4a7c-adf5-3a6544d803ad.md)

## Migrating UUIDs to Proquint-Like identifiers

I've been thinking, and I think 80 bits of randomness is probably plenty, and UUIDs for these notes are overkill.

I've been *considering* converting all UUIDs in this note tree to names like what I describe in the fantasy idea: using the last six bytes of the UUID as the "first and last names", and the first four bytes as the "middle name".

I've developed this idea into "badifogu", a script for which is now in the [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) repo.
