# Reworking the Unusual Studio Project List Website

The current relationship between the website and the Project List repo could be better.

- [x] Create a GitLab group for Unusual Studio.
- [ ] Move the website stuff to a GitLab Pages repo.
- [ ] Figure out how the Projects page should work.
  - I was previously thinking the best thing would be keeping the Projects repo separate, and then integrating it as a submodule of the website Pages repo.
  - I'm now looking at [just merging them all into these notes](2kxcv-axa9h-eaast-sp16j-wvg0f).
  - note that on I think the "more work on Projects" page I noted that the site should really be overhauled to read from the database dynamically, as well as the dataset for these notes and more in the future
    - Having the "project data" content originate in these notes (especially if that's moved out to "portfolio.stuartpb.com") would help make the Projects page more dedicatable to that
      - There's a note on that page to split off and link here
