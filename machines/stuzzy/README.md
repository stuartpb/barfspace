# stuzzy

(Not to be confused with "stuzee", the machine name for my old HP Touchsmart TX2Z running Windows 7.)

Currently, the changes listed in this repo describe an installation that was going to be called "stukilla", as a Mark II of the previous "stukilla".

However, I'm now planning on running a new installation *on the same machine that hosted the previous stukilla* and having it keep that name, so I chose, when rebuilding this system, to give it an all-new title.
