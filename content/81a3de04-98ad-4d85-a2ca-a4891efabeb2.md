# On Bad Defaults

I've been using [VS Code](73ce0d7f-758e-40ef-ae0a-c37e4a5bf2cd.md), and like every editor, it has its good sides and bad sides.

The thing is, the little things I have to tweak are frustrating.

Another thing like this: I still specify EDITOR= when I run terminal commands (both inside and outside VS Code), and it's because I don't want to set a .profile.

Why do I suffer through bad features? Well, for one thing, I dpn;t want to get set in my ways: I want to try different ideas about how things should work.

Also, I don't want to get too reliant on any one feature, as I might need to use another stack that doesn't have it.

But largely, I'm realizing now, it's because I know *I could scaffold all day and not get anything done*, and I don't want to fall down the spend-all-day-tweaking-settings-that-I-might-forget-I-enabled-and-get-dependent-on-and-then-my-workflow-dies-when-they-are-refactored-out-or-I-jump-platforms rabbit hole.

Like, when I was a kid, I remember spending all day tweaking my keyboard settings, or my Time and Date locale, or my bookmarks hierarchy or my hard drive layout or my color scheme or all kinds of things that *did not affect my productivity worth a damn*.

That's one of the key motiviations behind [the bagtent arbitrary content graph model](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) - I don't need to worry about hierarchies so much, because I can establish them *as needed*.
