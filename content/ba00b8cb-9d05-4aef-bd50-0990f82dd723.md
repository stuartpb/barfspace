# plans for bagtent itself

This is going to be my little scratchpad for initial ~~thoughts~~ plans on bagtent itself for a moment

actually this is just for plans, [this page][using] is for reflections, and together *these* are the "thoughts"

bagtent should have a web ui

I'm also thinking, like, have it be something that can work like workflowy? like, every time there's a list and a link, do the search thing, and have "create (literal symbol)" as an option at the end to create a new page, which is inline-inserted

maybe have an extension that lets you open a new document (with a link to the current page or whatever) and works like the bagtent-sprout script, in that you have to pick a document to add it to (from a dropdown that sorts by pages with most inter-content links)

that can actually be a feature in the post script, it looks up which files have the most outbound links and suggests them for addition first

similarly, that can be the main heuristic (or, rather, default sort heuristic, or maybe just a tiebreaker)

each menu takes either a search string, a number, or maybe a colon-prefixed line that's a command like `:sort inbound:ascending,match` to make longest-match only the tiebreaker sort for pages with the fewest inbound links (or you could even sort outbound first)

maybe that should be how the line works by default, there's number prompts, letter commands, and then like vi/less, you can type `/` or `:` or `-` or `+` to do searches, commands, or param settings (respectively). maybe also have something like a backtick for prefix-split (ie. the default for non-alias) and  `~` for fuzzy searches? and maybe `'` for literal search (closing single quote is optional and is treated like closing brace in `test`, where it ignores only the last one if present)?

how do I inject a suggested character to the read buffer? do I just have to listen for backspace and fake having a character in the buffer before the actual start of the line?

I'm thinking all configuration can be by environment variables, `BAGTENT_DEFAULT_FIRSTLINK_SORT` or stuff like something like that

I can also use `bagtent` to demonstrate how ideal version of git's "did you mean" would work: there's a prompt that defaults to "no", options are "no" (the default), "yes" (), "suggest" (which just prints, like Git's default), "presume" which can take a list of commands it's safe to presume, `window` which gives a window to hit Yes to correct (and can take a list), `countdown` which gives a window to hit no to cancel (and can take a list)

have an option for whether the countdown should update after being printed, if there's a countdown

maybe some kind of way to structure this, like maybe it's comma-separated-list-of-commands-that-can-include-wildcards,equals,option,colon,time(which can go with "yes" or "no", so "presume" and "suggest" are just wordy aliases for "yes:0" and "no:0", and then countdown and window are respective aliases that have some sort of default (maybe there's a thing that lets you set aliases, like maybe I want to configure "fastcount" and "slowcount" for "yes:3" and "no:10"

Actually, it's important to establish here that, in these examples, "yes" and "no" need to consistently refer to whether they're giving a *window* in which to hit enter/space to, or whether it's a countdown until that default happens

maybe that's the ticket, you're specifying the default with "enter:yes" or "space:yes" or "enter:no" or "space:no", where space is normally no... the layout is

maybe it needs to go like CSS where it supports two contradictory specification styles, "countdown:10,yes:space" or "window:10,enter:no"

nah, it should go:

- time of countdown
- what option will be picked if the countdown ends
- what hitting enter does
- what hitting space does

because, remember, all of these accept "yes" and "no", and these are all valid combinations. so I guess then the order for normalcy would be:

- 'n' for if enter and space default "no", 'y' for if enter and space default "yes", 'yn' for if enter means 'yes' but space means "no" (maybe "window" is a synonym for this), 'ny' for if enter means no but space means yes (and "countdown" is a synonym for this)
- countdown defaults to what space does (and space can also be specified as "y:n" or "n:y" kinds of things, where "y:y" and "n:n" just give the same effect as y
- this means default for a countdown, if you're just specifying a duration, can be specified like "y:10" or "10:y"

time is interpreted as seconds unless it ends with "ms" in which case it's parsed as milliseconds

anyway this would have to also have an option that's just "prompt" which only takes y/n literally (or maybe a list of aliases for each? hmm, is there a way that can make sense in the "menu")

another thing I'd like to add is a script that adds / allows for a metadata file listing content files that don't accept new internal links, eg. for deprecating a page

could also allow for some kind of ACL structure, where all commits from "owners" of various files are auto-merged (so long as they're appropriately rebased)

ownership and selections like that can recursively delegate by link (in a second system that maybe compiles into a raw UUID list, or maybe it's a directory of "maintainers" or "owners" by username/owner name, or owners themselves have UUIDs - actually, let's say the user system would work by directories, where the user directory names can be whatever you want), but you probably want that to be filtered by stuff like "child that only has parents/inbounds under this root" or "isn't owned by one of these / any users"

exclusive ownership can also be handled by some higher-level thing that can reject multiple ownership by checking some extended constructs

maybe that directory can be "authors"

you can have authors updated by some kind of CI or tooling or whatever from content (or vice versa), but that's your own thing to figure out (in that case, you can make your authors by UUID of the file that defines them)

there's also of course aliases (maybe that'd be the default namespace for non-numeric or prefixed lines - and aliases that are numbers get populated as default options, if they're within the range of the list)

part of me feels like aliases should be called refs, but, nah, refs are namespaced, aliases live in one namespace (though I guess that namespace allows directory separators)

I recommend having a restriction against any two data types (content, authors, assets, etc) share a UUID if one isn't directly defined by the other (though things like a scheme where there's a subdirectory of assets as attachments to content, it's OK to structure those by UUID of the content they're attached to, as that's not a structure the way "an asset" is)
