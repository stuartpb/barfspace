# Influences, Samples, and Reasons to Tell The Unconvincing Truth

Here's all the things that inspired something in [my first act as a magician][TUT].

Thoughts on copyright and the public domain might go here.

## Having Fucking ADHD

This show is really about conveying what it fucking feels like to have ADHD: there's *so much there* under the surface, but if you're not able to explore it, you're just gonna freaking miss it altogether. You never know where thoughts are going to take you, if there's going to be a point to anything, or if you're about to just go down a massive dead end, or discover something deeply important.

This show is for all the fucking Spoonies out there.

## Being Female (to whatever extent)

Like, as gender roles go, as I see it, Masculinity generally represents Attack, and Femininity represents Defense. (and I guess declaring yourself nonbinary is a kind of Throw) And one of the things about defense (this also ties into what one has to do to thrive with a disability), is you have to surround yourself with a lot of protection. Which is the function of all the traps.

## Rebecca Meyer

Another reason I need to do the show is because people are constantly asking me why I don't work for a company where "I could make good money" like Amazon or Google

## That One Professor

I had a few teachers, a few role models like this in my life, and maybe I'm just thinking about how they seemed wise relative to the kind of person I was at the time, but the most *terrifying* people in the world to me when I was a shitlord punkass were the ones who *weren't fazed by my edgy threatening performative masculine crap* - the ones who could just see who I was inside, and responded not with fear, an , but with abject *pity*.

The thing was, they seemed to be too afraid of letting me *be* comfortable. That was why I couldn't really trust them. I felt like I needed a Mister Rogers type, who just wanted me to feel *loved*, you know?

## Explicit influences

These are things I mention pretty heavily in the act as influences:

- Schindler's List (especially the scene where all the women are herded into an execution chamber, the nightmarish shower scene from Schindler's List was a big influence on my comedy act)

The shower scene from Schindler's List was a huge influence on my comedy act. People who come and see my show - whether they knew it or not - fall into three categories, and I can tell it based on their reaction to that joke:

- People who have seen Schindler's List, who just smile, nod, and maybe breathe a sigh of relief
- People who haven't seen Schindler's List but know a few things about the Holocaust, who laugh their *asses* off
- People who don't know anything about the Holocaust, who go "aw shit, he *is* gonna strip! I didn't vote for Donald Trump to see this!"

## Comic influences

- **The Unbelievable Truth**, which, if that's still going, I would obviously want to appear on
- Eugene Mirman
- Nathan Fielder (really, Nathan for You)
- The Stanley Parable (the museum ending where you see all the possible ways the game can play out was a big influence on making these notes public)
- Everything else by Crows Crows Crows
- Maria Bamford and her work on demystifying mental illness
- Robin Williams
- Eddie Izzard (*especially* his joke about Englebert Humperdinck)
- Bizarro Comics (especially the framing device of Bizarre Wars allowing for a *lot* of weird stuff)
- Jim Gaffigan (especially his "this guy's a crackhead / what if a fish was in the audience" schtick)
- [Joel Dommett][] - I wonder if he's ever accidentally picked a person who *wouldn't* spontaneously trigger the confetti cannon at the one dark moment in the act, because the timing on how quick the guy pressed the button here is *incredible*
  - Oh right, I forgot that it ends with a Schindler's List gag too
- Blue Man Group
- Patton Oswalt and his immortal "fuck me for building a moment" routine
- Dana Gould did a Netflix special that never came out
- Jason Pargin, a genius better known by the legacy of his shitty obtuse immature pen name David Wong

## Influences from (mostly-explicitly-mentioned) supervillains

- Mission Impossible III
- fucking Raul Julia in Street Fighter
- Eh, the Addams Family too, why not, they're a bunch of scary but good people

## Influences specifically around Bell

- The President's Analyst
- the "Judge Reinhold" episode of Arrested Development
- Portal (Bell's GlaDOS routine)
- Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, of course
- The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (Steve's entire life, especially the Jaguar Shark, is an unconvincing truth)

## Sampled Material

- The sound when the Belafonte powers back up is sampled for when the Clapper brings the lights back
- HAL 9000's lines (like, I kind of want to program all of them into Bell):
  - Good morning, Dave
  - I'm sorry I'm afraid I can't do that
  - It must be human error

## Reserve of alt prompt references

- April Moon
