# sturling local changes as of 2013-07-04

(This doesn't list installed packages: you can use "pacman -Qq" for that.)
(Also not listing global npm/luarocks packages, for the same reasons)

## During install

- hostname changed to sturling in rc.conf
  - something else added it after "localhost" in /etc/hosts, I don't know what when or how, but I didn't do it myself. Which is nice.
  - note that rc.conf was deprecated with systemd, see remarks from 2013-12-31
- uncommented en_US.UTF-8 line in /etc/locale.gen (that was stupid)
- /vfat added to /etc/fstab
  - /vfat options in /etc/fstab were changed from `defaults` to `umask=000` (to allow all users full access)
  - (the options tweak was actually done after the first boot but it could have been done in the install phase)

## Post install, pre-boot

- right after installing, GRUB was replaced with GRUB2
  - see the wiki - this is now the default
- `usb` added to hooks in /etc/mkinitcpio.conf right before `filesystem`
  - `autodetect` removed (so all possible root devices are present in the initrd, even though realistically they don't have to be)
  - I didn't realize usb was necessary until the system failed to boot: I had to follow the chroot instructions from the GRUB2 install and then run `mkinitcpio -p linux`
  - autodetect wasn't removed until much later, just for kicks
  - usbinput and fsck are there too after filesystem, not sure if I did that
  - 2013-02-14: replaced `usb pata scsi sata` with `block`, replaced `usbinput` with `keyboard`

## After booting

- "stuart" user made with `adduser` (NOT `useradd`)
  - NOTE: as of 2013-09-02, the `adduser` script [has been removed from Arch Linux](https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/32893): https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Users_and_Groups#User_management describes how to add new users with `useradd`.
- `%wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL` line uncommented with `EDITOR=nano visudo`
- `usermod stuart -aG wheel` (could really have been done during user creation if I'd been thinking)
  - likewise: power, audio, video, optical, network, games, kvm
  - I used `usermod -G` the first time, when I should have used `usermod -aG` (add, not clobber)
  - but moreso should have used `gpasswd -a stuart wheel`

- wlan0-Mussroom network configuration added in /etc/network.d/ (based on /etc/network.d/examples/wireless-wpa)

- systemd, systemd-arch-units and systemd-sysvcompat were all installed
  - sudo systemctl enable lxdm.service
    - other enabled services: ntpd
    - net-auto-wireless and net-auto-wired were enabled until I replaced them with NetworkManager
  - /etc/hostname, /etc/timezone, /etc/locale.conf added
  - `LANG=en-US.utf8` added to /etc/environment

- manually adding a non-graphical entry to /boot/grub/grub.cfg every time it gets regenerated (whatever the syntax is to set multiuser.target)

- uncommented/added multilib repository in /etc/pacman.conf
  - (could I have done this via menus in installation? dunno)

- moved ~/.bashrc to ~/.profile and changed ~/.bashrc to '. $HOME/.profile'
- changes to ~/.profile:
  - `alias ls="ls --color=auto"` complicated into three lines with `LS_OPTIONS="--color=auto"`
  - added ~/bin to front of $PATH and exported it
  - created ~/.bash_functions and sourced it (from .profile)

- created ~/.inputrc to set `show-all-if-unmodified` and `completion-ignore-case` on

- commented line disabling magic sysrq in /etc/sysctl.conf
  - (later obsoleted by systemd - see 2013-12-31 for corresponding adjustment)

- added entries for swap partitions (by label, made in spare space on host systems) in /etc/fstab
  - one for the disk and one for an SD card fallback

- added wins to /etc/nsswitch.conf's "hosts = " line

- /etc/systemd/logind.conf: `LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=no`
  - `HandleLidSwitch=ignore`, because not ignoring the inhibition apparently wasn't enough

## Stuff that should be upstream

- Tecgraf lua libraries linked with http://www.tecgraf.puc-rio.br/iup/download/config_lua_module
  - cdlua51 was fixed manually
- /usr/share/xsessions/Notion
  - I thought I did it as /etc/X11/sessions/notion.desktop but that doesn't appear to exist
   - /etc/X11/Sessions/notion seems like it would be closer to normal
- /usr/share/applications/transmission-qt.desktop Exec line patched manually (%F -> %U) to fix magnet link opening, rather than waiting for the packager to fix it
  - fixed December 2012 (noted 2014-01-02), see https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/29909?opened=12873&status%5B0%5D= for history / upstream link

## In the X desktop environment

- Tweaks to preferences in Transmission

- added shortcuts for "amixer set Master <10%+, 10%-, toggle>" in Xfce's Keyboard Shortcuts configuration

- compiz... started? not sure if enabled.
  - emerald theme changed to, what, beryl yellow or something. I like it.
  - whole bunch of compiz modules enabled:
    - all the render plugins
    - Static Application Switcher

### XFCE

- ~/.config/xfce4/xfconf/xfce-perchannel-xml/xfce4-session.xml edited to have this (enabling Compiz):
  ```xml
  <property name="Client0_Command" type="array">
      <value type="string" value="fusion-icon"/>
      <value type="string" value="--force-compiz"/>
  </property>
  ```

- fun XFCE panel layout with apps at the top and widgets at the bottom
  - made the apps unsorted and draggable

### XScreensaver

- Xscreensaver installed, lots of screensavers disabled, lots more tweaked

- `chmod u+s /usr/lib/xscreensaver/sonar` (so ping works)
  - it still doesn't work but I no longer care (I disabled xscreensaver anyway)

- added heartbeat deactivation of xscreensaver to ~/.mplayer/config

## Task-oriented tweaks

### To download the Android source code

- Added lines from https://www.googlesource.com/new-password?state=android to ~/.netrc

## Historical tweaks

### Obsoleted by systemd

- dbus added to daemons array in /etc/rc.conf (why was it not there already? come on, arch linux)
  - ifplugd installed and added to array

- default login manager line was comment-changed from xdm to gdm (and then to lxdm with an added line) in /etc/inittab

- copied /etc/grub.d/10_linux to 15_linux_xrl, modified it to generate listings with the arg added to start at runlevel 5
  - (which was then moved to /vfat when installing systemd, so nobody gets confused)

### Obsoleted by netcfg -> NetworkManager

- original /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf moved to /etc/wpa_supplicant.conf.original
- WPA passphrase echoed into new wpa_supplicant.conf
