# trouble typing in the dark

I'm constantly misjudging keys on keyboard when I type on them like I do in the middle of the night. I know the layout in my bones, I just tend to overshoot when I'm putting my hand down (since I don't home).

maybe that's the solution, just always starting from F and J

wait, no, that's the thing. my biggest problem keys, especially in these notes / on this machine, are brackets and parentheses: ones far from the center. (I have similar problems on other machines: backslash instead of backspace is another one)

might just buy a glow-in-the-dark pen and make identifying marks on these edges?
