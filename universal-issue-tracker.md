# Grand Unified Ticket System

This is an idea I've had: an issue tracker dedicated to tracking issues with anything, whether it's a project that you control or not (think https://github.com/isaacs/github, but for anything). Like, you can just post an error message you've got, and people will find your issue via Google and post comments and links to solutions.

Like, I guess the big idea of this is to flip the traditional model of issue tracking on its head, that the power to collectivize issues should lie primarily with the *users*, with the developers *hopefully* engaging. Like, this isn't meant to supplant a project's issue management paradigm, when one's established and well-managed: it's to make it so a project doesn't *have* to have one of those things for users with problems to be able to find each other, diagnose the issue, and figure out fixes / workarounds.

One of the big features of this would be to interface with external trackers for tracking issue status; another cool feature could be basically setting up Google alerts for key apects of the issue (eg. the error message) automatically.

Also, looking at another project I had specced up many years ago, it might make sense to have a system for easily provisioning *private* tickets, to track things like RMAs and personal to-do lists.
