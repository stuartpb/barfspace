# Games With Problems on Linux

(either under Proton or just in general)

## Master Spy

Starts up with a white screen, then goes all-black as the sound plays.

## Staxel

Gets stuck at "Running elevated setup to associate extensions and firewall rules" - SIGINTing out has it proceed, then fail with an error message I can't copy to clipboard for some reason about it closing "quickly with error" (the error message window itself closes after like a second)

"Start game (compatibility mode)" gives the same result

## Steel Rats

Only lists "0x0" in resolutions in options
