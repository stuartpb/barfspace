## Also kind of musing-like

I'm not sure if this page should be the primary "category" for these, but:

### this is the closest page to a primary I could think of

- [Best Practices for Login Tokens][surpass-but-for-nilpass]

### it definitely works as, like, an affiliate musing

And, like, these were all arbitrary links I sorted pages into when I was first destructuring the repo, and I went many-to-one because I wanted it to be straightforward, but now the bagtemt glow cloud is really a-rollin' and it's no big deal if everything just sticks to everything
