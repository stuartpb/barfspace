# Project Weaving

This is a note all about keeping notes on projects here in sync with other Project listings I use.

The most notable is https://unusual.studio/projects/, which incorporated all the relevant data from my Trello board for projects I'd been using for years as a basis for [Unusual Studio](4598s-yrtrd-188dq-w6qdv-hajj3).

A lot of items on that project list could go here, and a lot of things here could be reflected there.

The things from there to here are generally found by just staring at the list, coming up with mount points for pages for the project that's in that list (as, unlike these notes, that list has no categorization scheme hindering a project's listing, and can pull ideas from anywhere on the Web), and copying the fragment URL over here.

The things from here that aren't reflected there are tracked [on this page](5t3mg-9fbhp-t29rc-ezsx7-k19ws).
