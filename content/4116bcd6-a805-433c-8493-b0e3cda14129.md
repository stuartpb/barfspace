# note on the MK3S

I did the MK3S upgrade for my printer, and I'm a lot less wary of switching filaments now that I'm not terrified of needing to service the extruder (or damaging / not being recognized by the weird fragile flaky filament sensor).

I had a note [in November 2018][emopost] about getting stuck trying to figure out what I wanted to use the current filament with, but this isn't as much of a fret any more.
