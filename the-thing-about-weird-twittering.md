so like, there's fastidious anal retentive people, and there's folks who give zero shits and do what they want with no explanation, and I just slide up and down that spectrum freely

and in my experience, the latter do as well, even if you don't see it in all their public work (and I mean, there are folks where you don't see it in ANY of their public work) - I think there's a fundamental human, like, thing, to know what you're doing when you're doing stuff like this, I mean, usually if I meet them offline and ask what the deal was they don't just answer me "rainbow potato salmon helmet", they can at least say why they did it, even if it looks completely inscrutable from the outside

but yeah that takes time and energy and effort and that's the thing these folks aren't doing, you know, "I got no time for the dudes who don't get it", and, like, okay, you do you, but it's opaque if you don't already know what's up, and it's so frustrating, because that's what keeps the folks who are a little more starched-collar from opening up and being free because they just see it as going crazy with no explanations and they're like "no, sorry, my brain WORKS", they see andorned rants about social justice with any sort of metaphor that relies on a context they don't have as just being "so random", and their brain filters it out as noise and then they're inoculated against changing in any way, and it sucks

this ties a lot into what I wrote with https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations/blob/master/the-deltas.md

explaining yourself is SO LAME but dude LIFE is SO LAME, all you're getting by not slowing down is a candle that burned even hotter before it left a thimblefull of ashes (yeah candles turn into wax, it's a shit metaphor, just pretend that candles burn to ashes)

if you take a little self-care space and slow down and re-introduce for folks to come on board, you can burn down THE WHOLE HOUSE instead (where "the house" is the patriarchy and all the stuff that, you know, SHOULD be burned down)
