# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few emergent pathways.

## The Journals

This has currently become the biggest lens into my notes: documenting progress on projects and personal stuff

- [Journals](e3eb3761-5e3d-4805-a666-3afc4056a59b.md)
  - [Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md)
    - the Hugo to Journals' Bart
    - specifically overlaps with the Research sub-branch

## Noteball Administratum

The [Noteball Adminstratum](93059823-4101-4f9c-adec-d67ea8f87c28.md) contains notes regarding these notes themselves. Commonly-accessed branches:

- the [Oozy Sewer](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) is a project specifically about studying emergent behaviors
- the [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) handles all non-content-based planning for the notes' implementation
  - the [bagtent index](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) managed there

## Check-Ins and Jam Sessions

- [Jam about Threads](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md)
- [Check-in stuff](d4637819-c2a1-4e08-ad35-da2f28a2ae25.md)

## Other branches

- [Pitches and Scripts](b297a6f8-5646-4ce1-9be1-d7ed6056a513.md)
- [The Spirit World in the Machine](8558bb98-b9ff-4164-906f-feee17311f4b.md)

- [Pure and Utter Posting](f5a80e28-65e7-43c0-ad4e-82c1ef0f0409.md)

## Etcetera

[Taverns and Commissaries](d4d2fdbe-4cea-4de0-aa53-90646d3d5346.md) gathers the long tails of any content in these notes that doesn't fit somewhere above (yet)
