# Hysteresis? Am I using that word right?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hysteresis

I'm familiar with the concept in the abstract, though I only rediscovered the word while looking into the Argon1 Pi hat stuff.

I feel like it's an interesting concept to extend out, like in [describing what it would take to change back to Contour](st2tq-tv937-g58jw-c9pmw-1ydr1)
