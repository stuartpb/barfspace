running `pacman -Syu` as I bootstrap the new sturling

## stray observations

I like how Atom (and probably editors it's inspired by) do auto-opening a file: there's one persistent "preview" tab that switches between files you're not editing, and you can move it and everything, and it changes to "real" tab status if you double-click the file or start editing within the preview (at which point the next preview will open a new tab for that).
