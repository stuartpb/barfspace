# Component Ideas

This is a page collecting project ideas that make sense as a feature or enabling technology behind some larger system

It's like [Scaffolding and Frameworks](d78bdabf-6401-489e-a284-51c500826748.md), but from the other side

There's also some overlap with [Methods](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md)

- [alphabinary](a92da7dd-0bba-44ba-8e5a-743571caab3e.md)
- Hashblot and Hashsplat
- [surpass / Gross Simplification](4abecfee-9100-45f3-9566-4d5234924dd2.md)
- timewaiter
- [envigor](265f23de-445d-44d3-acfc-66e316cb03a2.md)

## Not mine, but in the same vein

A lot of Doug Crockford's stuff, like his Base32 spec (and JSON ofc)
