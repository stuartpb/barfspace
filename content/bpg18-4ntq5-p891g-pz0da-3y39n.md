# Shit to Prove

I hate being misunderstood. (There ought to be a page about that, because it's been a common theme for me, and how it tends to come from "infinity ignoring itself".)

A thing I've noticed is that, due to whatever fucked up psychology I have, being misunderstood or dismissed is one of the *strongest motivators* I have toward pursuing projects. Like, I'll see the strangest stuff through to fruition if someone is dismissing it as "overambitious" or worthless or otherwise thinks it's their job to second-guess me.
