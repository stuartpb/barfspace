# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose kind of overarching contexts that are constantly shifting.

To read some notes that may suggest the nature of these shifts and contexts, you may visit the [Department of Barfspace](eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md), the official headquarters for notes on these notes.

## Plans and check-ins

[Right Now](41218b84-cd08-48a5-b91a-865e8b90c46a.md) is an index page for a bunch of pages that give insight into what I'm up to (that is similar to but doesn't *quite* match the list below, because it covers smaller stuff and isn't updated as much):

- [Quests](6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md), which has kind of turned into my "To Do" lists
- [News](afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md), the most distinctly journal-esque division of notes
- [Pet Machine Journals](1c1b77bb-9e37-4d0a-9dd2-5bafbeee15f5.md)
- [Soft Projects](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) and [Hard Projects](b2694758-f919-4d46-a29b-7bbf189eab38.md)
- [Study Notes](9403033b-a238-47d1-865b-4e1baa0f2577.md)

## Other facets of my life right now

- [Shopping lists](d14eeacb-1729-485a-9e76-9cceb484862f.md)
- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air](45fc3859-ce9b-4317-afd9-7d3f52dc5dd2.md)
- [The Left Side of the Notes](d601d7ba-522b-4d6d-9e3b-101885e7aa00.md)
- [Working for Money](8f63bba6-1b90-484d-a51c-1bc74fccd3d8.md)
- [Wedding Plans](5a2f660d-e3c1-4b7a-848d-5147b44744e7.md)
- [Comedy Moleskine](95cc0bfb-0ae8-4bba-8bf0-1c76f0c8fe0e.md)

## Lean Notes

[Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md) is the term describing a big chunk of my notes that's dedicated to exploring and documenting how stuff can be put together.

A lot of its current content is in a bunch of Trello boards that haven't been copied here, and a lot of those Trello boards aren't even full of all that much content themselves.

[Everybody Gets a Factory](8cbd867d-1a63-4d1f-9c83-cab019fe87bd.md) is a more recently-worked-with body of notes on the general "maker" sphere.

[Journeys](9403033b-a238-47d1-865b-4e1baa0f2577.md), my self-teaching study notes, is kind of a "raw feed" into the stuff that goes into these notes:

the [Spec Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), where experimental best practices are drafted, is like the other pole, where experience is thoroughly condensed into whole frameworks.

## Understanding Lua

This is kind of like Lean Notes, but instead, it's a draft for a graphic-novel-style introduction to key programming concepts through Lua.

Right now, it lives kind of outside of these notes: I've started an [Understanding Lua root][] for bringing it in from its current home.

## More freeform / creative-writing-type stuff

much of which dates back to the pre-bagtent era of [barfspace][]

- [Meditations and Musings][MnMs], which is sort of a catch-all for standalone pages in these notes that have some kind of philosophical or pragmatic topic
  - There's also [Big Titles][], for what feel like "big ideas" that can encompass a whole book. Many of these haven't really materialized, but maybe making them more accessible by putting a link into them on the front page here would help.
- [Raw emotional stuff][raw] - for when it's like that, but it's *way* less easy to articulate cleanly
- [Silly shit][tumblr], for shitposts
- [Pitches and Scripts][], for story premises, character study, dialogue bits, things like that - this is really a kind of big subsection of the notes, really.

[MnMs]: 8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md
[Big Titles]: e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md
[raw]: a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md
[tumblr]: e1cae26c-3271-48ac-aa0c-a085fa4aa211.md
[Pitches and Scripts]: b297a6f8-5646-4ce1-9be1-d7ed6056a513.md

## Reactions

[The Tasteland][Tastes] is a branch of the notes where I'm keeping reviews and things like that

[Tastes]: 6661cd90-c9a6-4f7a-97cc-3eb47f9dee2e.md

## Collections

Here are some pages that just collect links to stuff so I don't forget it (and an [index page][metalinks] for linkdumps that aren't top-level like these).

- [Stuff I Have Read][read collection]
- [The Linkdump][]
- [My Old Google Bookmarks][Old Bookmarks]

[metalinks]: 0f18ba9f-dc5f-4b1a-a5da-50d09ce3e9d3.md
[read collection]: 2593b86b-8504-4c6e-af09-501c6a54ef67.md
[The Linkdump]: 1337e279-9790-4c24-aeeb-56337c994726.md
[Old Bookmarks]: 878e8967-fa5d-423d-8ac0-b369138ae10f.md

## Miscellanea

Here's the long tail of where notes that don't easily fit in any of the cleaner buckets above fall:

- [The Rest][]: for when I really, really, really don't want to classify something as any of the above
  - [Weird Stubs](231786d3-4a9b-4451-9df1-e2049b90b0fe.md), for other pages needing more love
- [Appendices][], single-document clearinghouses for various bite-sized thoughts
- [Loose Notes][]: The Last Appendix, for ideas that don't even warrant their own page, and don't already have a suitable appendix page I can figure out right when I need to start writing them. I can tear them off and give them pages (possibly sorted, even) or move them to an Appendix later.

[Appendices]: f161276f-fd3c-49bb-93b1-3e99aab9e266.md
[The Rest]: fd071a93-8373-4adc-84c6-ae781c7d0442.md
[Loose Notes]: ff47c3c8-6686-4225-ba27-23f61c604e0d.md
