# Stuart P. Bentley: The Unconvincing Truth

**DON'T READ THESE NOTES, SEE THE SHOW.** This is just where I'm writing stuff that I'll need to rehearse before doing it, planning out materials, stuff like that.

Seriously. Don't read these notes.

## SPOILERS FOR THE ENTIRE SHOW START HERE

(before emerging onstage, I put on my robe and wizard hat, holding a whiteboard marker as a wand. "WHAT'S SO FUNNY?" is written on the whiteboard)

This is the part of the show known as the "cold open". Brr. It's the part of the show where you don't really know anything about me, or what kind of act I could do. I can do anything. In your heads, I'm doing *everything*. It's a kind of magic. Like how, if you've heard that Queen song, the one from Highlander, it's now stuck in your head, but if you haven't, when it comes to this joke I'm just wasting... your... of TIIIIIIIME! Is this? A kind? Of magic?

See? I put that thought in your head. Inception! BRAAAAAAHHHHHMMMMMM. And now it's not stuck in your head any more, because that big blaring horn from the Inception soundtrack is in your BRAAAAAAAAAAHHHM.

Magic! This is a magic show. I'm a big believer in magic. You may not guess it from what I'm we- oh, the Cold Open's over.

(drops slanket to reveal my usual wardrobe of a shirt, tie, tactical vest and construction-worker pants)

You wouldn't guess it from the way I'm dressed, but (puts on hat) I'm a magician. I'm like a sucky magician, though, I'm no good at concealing things in my hands. I'm not even really good at concealing things in my head - Autism spectrum thing - which is why I don't do any of these things performers usually do to distance themselves from the audience as possible: I want to get as close to the audience as possible (this part should be said while walking over the audience seats), but I don't want you straining your necks, so I won't pull any more first-year-theater-gimmicks like that. What is this, Equus?

Okay, I'm not really sure how to work this into the act, but that was Burning Down the House, by Tom Jones and the Cardigans. Seriously, if you're listening, and you're thinking that this sounds like a cross between *It's not unusuAL!* and *SAY that you love me, fool me, fool me*, it's not Talking Heads, it's *literally the people who made those two songs*. It's like the original "Weezer covers Africa" of "wait, are you fucking serious, I thought you'd just never heard of the band that actually wrote that song"

Also, Weezer's Africa is better than Toto's, fight me. Don't fight me! NEVER fight me.

This show is pretty straightforward, it's me dealing with all the horrors of the world I've had to endure. All my life, I've had people laughing at me, and only very recently did I realize it was because I'd been telling jokes.

See, I have an autism-spectrum disorder. I've never been diagnosed - well, that's a lie, I was diagnosed by like three separate therapists as having "Aspergers", but that's just because it was the new trendy thing to diagnose kids with because everybody wants to tell people they've got ass burgers.

But, yeah, an understanding of these disorders as being on a *spectrum* is something that's only emerged in the broader mental-health consciousness more recently, a spectrum that also manifests as ADHD, which if you ask me is *way* the hell more accurate than Asperger's, and *way* the hell cooler to say.

And, like, disorder isn't the term I like to usewant to make it clear very early on that *I am okay*. I am in control of my actions, I don't go into dangerous emotional territory in this act without having planned it out as a stunt *extensively*.

### the main disclaimer bit

Mention the Hollow Earth thing, Charlie

Mention Emmett Montgomery and Sugarplum Gary

It's okay to laugh

It's okay to cry

And it's best to do both at the same time

### segueing into the stuff where reality really starts to fucking warp

Orson Welles produced a documentary for the 1973 San Sebastian Film Festival called F for Fake, where he opens by saying, I know you guys think I'm a trickster, I fucked with y'all with The War of the Worlds, and someone *may have* killed themselves over it, but for the next hour, I will not tell you a *single lie*.

That movie is 88 minutes long, and for the last twenty minutes, he lies like a fuckin' *bastard*.

I'm not gonna do that to you. Folks with good imaginations got enough people calling them pathological liars.

I'm not telling you these things because I want you to believe them. I'm telling you these things because I want you to *not* believe them. I live for the look on people's faces when they realize the twist, [the prestige][] of knowing the outrageous things I've told them were all true. Shock, joy, laughter, awe. Discovering something that was heard but not seen, where what was magic, all at once, becomes real. That's the beauty that makes *me* smile. **That's what's so funny.**

[the prestige]: https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/prestige#Etymology

### Move into the David Wain stuff here

(Erases the question mark on the white board)

Well... okay, that's not *quite* true.

(Rewrites the question mark)

As comedians, we're always preoccupied with this question. Sure, we could be funny, but comedians don't want to be *funny*, they want to be *so* funny.

And what's so funny? It's simple.

(erases the question mark)

A thing is funny if it isn't true.

So, for example, if I told you that I had eggs for breakfast this morning, that wouldn't be funny, because, you know, it's true.

But if I told you that I wafGUFFAWles - that I had (snrt) *waffles* for breakfast this morning...

But if I told you that I saw a piano catch fire and fly through the air and explode into a rainbow-colored shower of a million different pieces, raining black and white keys all along the countryside, well, that isn't funny, because it's a hundred percent true.

Actually, this isn't my theory of comedy, it's David Wain's.

(Rewrites the question mark again, writes a second one)

See, I think things that are true can be funny. You just have to make them sound adequately fake.

Okay, obviously the piano didn't *just fly* there. It was helped, by the 20-story 600-ton trebuchet in this guy's backyard.

Okay, he didn't just *happen to have* a 14th-century siege engine lying about the place. He built it himself, obviously. For kicks

That man's name was Hugh Kennedy, and he's the most amazing, pointlessly wealthy guy I've ever seen. I didn't just hear about him on TV. My dad met him at the North Pole.

"Is your dad Santa Claus?" No, man, that's Sugarplum Gary, you have to come around in the holiday season, see Emmet's show

Anyway, David Wain - Welcome to my comedy show, where I just tell you about a bunch of other people's comedy shows

He did this *amazing* sketch for The State that I borrowed that joke from, but the original sketch is so much more hardcore than I could ever do, and the only place I can find online is this AV Club article

Nobody learns anything and the frog dies

Most comedians that I know have a *sense* for what makes a joke funny or not, that's deep, and important, but not something they've ever really been able to articulate. It's something you can really only build up from years and years and years of careful observation, genuflection, and introspection.

Luckily, I've got a two-step flowchart that explains it.

(Erases the question mark again, puts the thing in a box)

### The final content warning

I just want to reiterate one more time here. I am okay. And *you are okay*, too. (two okay hands come up like goggles)

(hands quick down) FUCK! White supremacists are trying to turn the OK hand into a gang sign. You know, Crips (flashes C), Bloods (flashes blood),

I am not a fan of white supremacists, but I'm a *big* fan of doing *this* (okay hand), so, fuck 'em, they don't get to have it. It's ours: the fucking normal people. The people of America, the most normal and okay country where everything's fine in the world right now.

### Really getting into the meat of the show

Story about a veteran, who came back from where he was deployed for X years, and when he got back, the country he'd served suddenly ceased to really give a shit about him, and he fell in with these white supremacist guys, and some time around here he starts to get into drugs, mostly amphetamines - the opiate crisis in this country is *horrific*, I'm gonna put this pill bottle here so I don't forget to talk about it later - and one night, these guys - they're racists, but they're also not a big fan of queers - they get this idea, this plan, for an act they think it'd be just *swell* to do, so they get together and they call it THE HOLOCAUST! His country was Germany! The vet was Hitler! The year was 1937 to 1944, Over six million Jews died! Aren't you glad I cut the *tension*? Over six million, all dying in ways more horiffic than where you might have thought this joke was heading.

To be clear, I fucking hate Nazis. Seriously. If you come out of this show remembering one thing about me, you can forget my name, just remember *that guy really fucking hated Nazis*. Tell your friends. You can tell them I have a joke about an Atheist, a rape victim, a Rabbi, and a priest trapped in a church on 9/11 with a punchline that falls *completely* flat (that one's coming up), but please preface it "you've gotta see this guy who *really fucking hates Nazis*".

Thank you for coming to my comedy show, where we learn about the Holocaust in between Disney songs (immediately launches into song)

I can show you the world,
Hitler's conquering Poland
Blitzing England and Scotland leads to the Atomic Bomb
IT'S WORLD WAR TWOOOOOOOO
A new horrific point of view
And there's nowhere to go,
it spans the globe, no matter
what you do, you're screwed
in World War II

*it's world war twoooooo...*

### The ending

I can't do it here, of course. Like I said, that'd burn the house down.

Bell, Ahoy Hoy! Prepare to end the show.

### Introducing all the traps

Tie joke

I like my shows like I like my salads: (starts unbuttoning shirt) no dressing.

No, that's not what I mean by *booby traps*! By booby traps, I mean devices rigged throughout the theater to go off at my command. That's what Bell's for. He's the closest thing on Earth to being able to summon the wrath of God.

Pull out lighter when we're not doing whiteboard stuff, maybe a Freebird thing

### Introducing Bell

Oh, I haven't introduced Bell yet! I usually don't. I just like to call out to him at some random point in the act where I need a function Bell's programmed with, and then people just see the phone

Like I said (or say here), nothing here is set dressing. *Or is it?*

### Flubs

Want a trick to make your act flawless? Practice *flubbing* a line. When you get really good at practicing a screwup, through some kind of magic, you get really good at making screwups look practiced.

### Botches

Ever notice how a lot of magicians are comedians? Penn and Teller, Justin Willman, my cousin Ted... uh... *some*... clowns...

But it's because being a comedian makes it easy to pass of a trick as a joke if anything goes wrong. And because, when you get *really* good at jokes, there's no way to make the joke funnier than punctuating it with magic.

### Giggles

When you're not doing a character, but you've got a show as thoroughly booby-trapped as this, you're always wondering: is *he* laughing at what *we're* laughing at? Which, the thought of that is usually what I'm *actually* laughing about.
