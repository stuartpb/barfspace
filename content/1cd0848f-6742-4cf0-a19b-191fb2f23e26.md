# Thoughts on a new iteration of the necklace's beads

I'm thinking I might try them a couple millimeters wider, like 18mm - targeting enough space to bend without showing too much cable between

I think I might like them to snap together a little more because of how they're *designed* than how they're *oriented* (see how the reoriented print failed to snap together at all).

I'm thinking something like three "wheels" carved out, ie. extending into the other side, and the wheels' negatives form tunnels

Anyway, one advantage of making these something that can be easily dismantled is that you can maybe snap them together, throw them in a rock tumbler (maybe in PETG if rock tumblers are too hot)

TODO: throw in links to rock tumblers, the DIY one on Thingiverse, etc
