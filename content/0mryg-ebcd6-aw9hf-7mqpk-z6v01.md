# Influences and Prior Art on Lean Notes / Zero to Software

## Prior Art

Software Engineering for Internet Applications: http://philip.greenspun.com/seia/ and its predecessor http://philip.greenspun.com/panda/index.html

https://github.com/north/north was another similar project in 2015 that I was actually thinking "I can link this in places"

[The Material Foundation guidelines](https://material.io/design/foundation-overview/) have a basis kind of like how I envisioned this looking (right down to the three "Up next" cards emerging at the bottom)

## Other stuff

hackety.com was listed on a list by itself under "Influences", the site appears to be dead now

I had a list called "Like the Wizards" that I think was supposed to represent the pipeline stuff of glasstubes that never materialized, which I am further reflecting on [here](0d8cc-k29em-qw93j-mj01y-dkf5a)

## Anti-influences

I had a couple things I knew I wanted to be *unlike*:

## Personal blog posts

Personal blog posts are common that vaguely pontificate on some of the concepts involved, telling you *where* you can do things (not being clear what's a *suggestion* and what's *reality*), like "get a domain from GoDaddy" (bad advice) or "create an account on GitHub" (essentially necessary).

## Learn Python the Hard Way

ARGH NONONONONONONO **NO**.

- Emphasis on typing
- Repetition
- Exercises

"If you copy and paste, you might as well just not even do them." *Hey, there's a thought!*

If you want to give people a reason to type, *don't give them something to copy-paste*. Tell them the syntax and have them write. That'll do a better job of "train[ing] your hands, your brain, and your mind in how to read, write, and see code" because it *makes these things connected* instead of teaching it like a *lecture tied to a mindless routine*.
