# Why Hyperfocus Leads to an Attention Deficit

This is one of the most frustrating things people get about ADHD: they think that my problem is a *lack of discipline*.

No, dude. The lack of attention is a *learned practice*. It's an *adaptation*. If you go back to My Old Bad Ideas, you'll see that a lot of them were distinguished by a lot of thought having been put into things *that didn't solve anything*.
