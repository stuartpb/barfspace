## throughhole refactor

I'm gonna punt on this again, but it'd be cool to have the channel to get the cable head in be hidden within the dock body, which would allow the cable to go straight through the base

I'm messing with this again... I feel like, even though the inner width is less than the plug width, I can make this work if the channel is wide enough - the cable can slip in at a slight Z rotation.

## rounded rectangle implementation

TBH, I think I'd rather make an "X origin, Y origin, X shift, Y shift" 90-degree point-plotter function (which'd actually be pretty easy), following a specified number of divisions (which could be scaled according to $fn and $fa), then use that to just create the rounded rectangles as polygons. Circles don't get any kind of special treatment internally (even though, y'know, they should), so this'd be just as good as the wacky, complex, unscalable solution we have now. And, it'd make it more tenable to plot more complex paths like the front face!

Taken a little further, this could be used as a basis for resurrecting the Millwork idea, generalizing it to "rounded paths"... I don't know, that's a problem for another time.
