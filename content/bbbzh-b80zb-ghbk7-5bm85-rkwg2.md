# More Chromebooks

I was originally going to swap out the other Toshiba chromebook here for a 2013 Chromebook Pixel, but the one that came was a UK unit.

I'm thinking now that, if I do want to introduce Chromebooks, I should really just look at getting remaindered ones from eBay with broken screens etc.
