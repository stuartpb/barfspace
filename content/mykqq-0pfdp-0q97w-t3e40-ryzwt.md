# Getting Back to Packet

Ok wow I definitely do NOT remember

oh geez, the rules are like:

- at least 10 characters
- at least 1 capital
- at least 1 digit
- at least 1 special character

I write down the schema I use to meet this requirement, weakening my attack space massively - should really report this to Packet

I forgot that password, but I came up with a much better one, so I guess it all works out?
