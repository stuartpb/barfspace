# Coda to stuzzy vulkan

Looks like this uses a Sandy Bridge chipset, which doesn't have a smooth pipeline to generalized compute, so the vulkan-intel driver doesn't support it, and isn't likely to in the future.

## unrelated

ran into an issue running an electron app 

```
error while loading shared libraries: libgconf-2.so.4: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
```

solved with `pacman -S gconf`

## another unrelated misadventure

unzipped a broken file that completely filled my disk space trying to unpack a PNG

Uninstalled Dota Underlords to free up space (before using baobab to determine that that PNG was taking up 76 GB) since I doubt this system will ever support Vulkan

when I get back to Seattle, I'll try streaming it from stushiba: I'm in Florida right now, and the buffer seemed to be frozen at the moment I turned off my monitor - I tried restarting Steam and GNOME, and the problem didn't get better.
