# Hash visualization

This is a little place in my notes for [hashblot](https://hashblot.com/) and [hashsplat](https://hashsplat.com/)

## Advantages of Hashblot

- Simpler implementation (doesn't need gradients, blend modes)

## Advantages of Hashsplat

- Handles more complex hashes
- More image elements allowing for more expressive visualizations
