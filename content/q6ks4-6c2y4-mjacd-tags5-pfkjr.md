# Alphabi broad searcher

The probability of finding a specific sequence in any series of bits is low for even very short runs of bits, let alone entire phrases: however, by loosening the parameters of the phrase being searched for into high combinatorics, one can *vastly increase* the chances of finding a matching phrase, under similar principles to a birthday attack.

I have some degree of uncomitted code for this.
