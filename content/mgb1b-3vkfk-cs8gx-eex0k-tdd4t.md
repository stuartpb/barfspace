# Notes on Understanding Lua's art style

See notes [on userdata](qqa16-vvtr0-c29wf-ys5gw-pep8d) for how art style can be used to distinguish non-diegetic elements and/or userdata.

Also, "sketch" style is what I'm thinking can illustrate a function being *defined* (and/or the function as a value), as described in the notes [On Functions](ypqj4-z5n8d-g18sx-jshhs-p5qwj).
