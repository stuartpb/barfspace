I don't think I did enable bluetooth so long ago, just ran `sudo systemctl enable bluetooth.service` and it said it made the files. anyway I still had to start it explicitly

anyway I added Stuixel by bluetooth

a thing I'm encountering now is where, half a second after blueman pops up, the window goes away, and clicking the tray icon just makes the dock have a spin-arrow cursor. idk how to fix this, but the context menu still... kind of... works

anyway the plane is descending so I'm just going to listen to Slow Burn and give up on this plan for now
