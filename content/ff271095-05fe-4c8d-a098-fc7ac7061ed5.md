# My 3D Printer Nozzle Status Headquarters

## The Nozzle Collector

- [ ] Consider getting a hardened nozzle from [E3D][] or [Micro-Swiss][].
  - Amazon's prices are cheaper than Prusa here.

## Nozzle changing

https://3dviking.wordpress.com/2018/05/11/fearless-nozzle-changes/ has some protips for nozzle changing

https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fJa7GxLSG6-changing-or-replacing-nozzle is the official manual page for it on the MK3S extruder.

- [ ] Tool up for nozzle changing.
  - [ ] [This][nozkit] kit comes with some, *plus* some nozzle sizes that Prusa doesn't ship settings for.

## Nozzle holding

- [ ] Print something to hold your nozzles between changes.
  - I was thinking something like individual nozzle slots on the top of the frame when not in use - these kits store a *lot* of nozzles? Like you wear out nozzles enough to keep three of each size on hand? w/e

## More nozzles

- [ ] Should you maybe get a new 0.4 brass nozzle to replace your current one, in case abrasive filament's worn it out?
  - Prusa beats [this price][Amazonozzle] (they charge $7.11 for a 0.4mm nozzle), so this might be a thing to order if you get more Prusa shipping.
