## Stuff I Used To Do on GitHub

These bagtent notes have superseded two previous tendencies that will probably get moved to another page by [History Force](bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md) at some point:

EDIT: actually, after revisiting How-I-Roll's Tomb, I think the other half of this will get absorbed into the Lean Notes top note (and then maybe worked into the structure over time), and then this page will stand as a legacy to How I Used to (Not) Write On GitHub
