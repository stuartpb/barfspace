# Notes on Sensors, Processing, and Machine Learning

Text not yet compiled, see Trello for planned content: https://trello.com/b/dUyrETvO/signal-processing-and-reading

## break this page out?

It feels like this is an umbrella for two ideas:

- Processing stuff like bar codes, DataMatrix - serializing signals out to other media, all that Data Smuggler stuff
- All the smart stuff that's only emerged since the Trello board for this was made
  - Hence why these lists were empty in the original board

They should probably get separate pages

## new stuff

TODO: Add anoy other further TensorFlow notes here
