# spongebob tampon song

This used to be on [the songs-in-my-head playlist](7fnrg-1czpy-jq80k-fftw4-ddcbb), but I've taken it off, because it actually doesn't fit the style of the rest of them. It's still linked from other pages so whatever

This is based on, no joke, a dream I had, where I somehow stumbled across a music video for this when I was clicking around on YouTube. So don't blame me, blame my subconscious. And don't blame me for the underlying premise, [I didn't come up with that, either](https://www.google.com/search?q=spongebob+tampon).

and yes, [I will accept patches / pull requests that fill in the remaining verses][PRs], even anonymously, you just have to live with yourself for having written it

## lyrics

> ARE YA READY, KIDS?

*"Aye aye, captain!"*

> OOOOOOOOOOOOooooooooOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAAAAAOW *(changes to Mark Ronson voice halfway through)*

This hit, when you know, Aunt Irma, that red flow<br>
This one's for them bud girls, them blood girls, straight menstruators<br>
Slidin', while in, living it up in the kitty<br>
Gotta shove on, and sing this song, go about our day sittin' pretty

Too hot (HOT CLAM!), gonna sponge off endometriam<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), pull me out when I retire, ma'am<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), say my name, you know what I am,<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), and I'm bout being absorbent / breaking down

Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)<br>
Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)<br>
Girls hit your hallelujah (whoo)<br>
'Cause Spongebob Squarepants is a tampon<br>
'Cause Spongebob Squarepants is a tampon<br>
'Cause Spongebob Squarepants is a tampon<br>
Saturday night, and we in the crotch<br>
Don't believe me? Just watch (COME ON!)

*(break)*
