# The New Plan for the Kubernetes Cluster

(I'm thinking I'm just going to straight-up call this personal cluster "Stubernetes")

TODO: recap all the network adapter ideas

metallb, reserving 192.168.32.0-192.168.63.255 for Stubernetes

Add another traefik for internal traffic, make sure there's a fixed loadBalancerIp in these new ranges for both

configure that into the router

Another CoreDNS instance (or two, if we decide to have a public-facing version?)

## Stuff after that

- notestack namespace, notestack.stuartpb.internal (and potentially notestack.stuartpb.com once it's public-exposable)
  - GitLab
  - GitPod
  - JupyterHub
  - dat
- dashboard on the internal interface
- possibly extending this out to an experiment with a new Pi0W (which I *might* give a DHCP reservation to?) and pogo pins
