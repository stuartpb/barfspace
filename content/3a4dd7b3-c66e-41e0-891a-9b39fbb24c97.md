# Fussing with the Pearl Plate

I think the humidity is making my transparent PLA really-expandy.

I was trying to print a plate of 12 halves: I kept getting the first layer gumming up on itself.

First I tried tightening the idler, which made it happen a little later (one or two would print): then I tried raising my live Z, which only kind of worked at absurdly high offsets like -0.4 where the plastic was practically coming off anyway.

I also tried upping my mesh leveling to 5 reads per point: this did nothing

bumping the temperature up to 220C for the first layer solved the problem
