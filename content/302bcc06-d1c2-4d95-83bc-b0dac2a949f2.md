this'd be a service

tech side, you can have it so X percentage of authority revoked requires explicit operator approval

the service would be a person who you can tell "yeah, we had to fire an employee, we're sending you the termination papers" and there's whatever level of pre-agreed-upon thoroughness to prove not only that this isn't an attacker, but that it's not a rogue abuse of power in breach of contract and state law (all Revokum operators would be legally bound to NDAs with outside parties, citing CIA-like "can neither confirm nor deny" policies)

you can have higher level of confirmation (ie. more officers needed to confirm) for revoking, like, a datacenter's worth of credentials due to a lost developer laptop or something
