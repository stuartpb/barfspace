# other names considered for the Oozy Sewer

The Oozy Sewer really kind of captures the picture I have for this page, really, but I did come up with some intermediate ideas before landing there:

- the Academy for Mutants
  - (a Devo-style "Mutant Beauty School" would be funny but also be liable to make this sound nothing like what it is and kill it)
- Emergent Architecture Studies
