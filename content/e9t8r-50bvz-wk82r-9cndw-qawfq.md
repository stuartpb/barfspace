# On Bagtent Threading as Actual Communication

You could have actual "realtime communication" as edits to a distributed wiki

You have private branches tracking your "sent", and can establish private inboxes to other users to "whisper" them, and they can choose to publicize the interaction with whatever context by merging your patch to their public branch, or whatever

Anyway, the editor interface for all this would submit a change whenever you end a line

You can chomp off a "subheading" if you're planning to write a whole multi-paragraph screed

Rather than finagle with sorting out ownership of a line by git blame, maybe your client automatically signs every "thread response" with your @ (ie. a local-or-remote username like in the Fediverse)

or maybe you include something like a "#sign" keyword
