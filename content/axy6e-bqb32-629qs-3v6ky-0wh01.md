Somehow I only installed SSH (as in the `openssh` package) **today**, whaaaaaaaa

I am just **stunned** I hadn't done that yet. I kinda thought it was part of the Arch base install, but I guess that's just libssh

I might generate some keys for this so I can get on GitHub, but I don't know, I'm kinda tired, maybe tomorrow
