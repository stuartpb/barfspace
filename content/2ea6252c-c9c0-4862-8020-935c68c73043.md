# Notes on numbers in Understanding Lua

These were comments on Trello:

- Note that numbers can be written in decimal, hexadecimal, or scientific notation
- Could go into how doubles work, but suffice it to say numbers are stored as complex rational numbers, and they keep complexity (they aren't just integers) with a high level of detail, like how scientific notation works. So, like, seven and three-fourths is a number, as is 0.00219726562

And this was a note in OneNote:

> Numbers: Abacuses with fixed beads representing the binary representation of the double

So yeah, something like a fixed object with three rows/columns of 4, and a digital readout of the exact underlying value in hex can run on the bottom to illustrate later - point being that a number is defined by the underlying bits

this could be a neat visualization you could make IRL: a seven-point-segment display atop a 16x4 LED array illustrating the underlying bits - if you use WS2812s, you can even do stuff like turn the exponent red for when all 11 bits are set and it represents NaN. you'd also want a calculator keypad on the side

## adjunct idea about floating point

this is actually kind of why I came back to start integrating the Understanding Lua stuff

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egyptian_fraction and particularly the Eye of Horus thing illustrate how you can express a number in divisions of 2, apocryphally
