# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose "grand projects" that will or will not blend together over time:

- [Lean Notes][] and [barfspace][], which are kind of the same thing, but one's more structured than the other
  - I'm planning to sort of mesh these two together more over time
- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air][FBBA], a Discordian rite within the larger Chaos

## Also

[my-old-bad-ideas.md][], which has a lineage dating back to when these files actually had *names*, is currently home base for merging a bunch of further projects into this one.
