# de-wifying

Removing my wifi information from the base config file via `sudo mount -o remount,rw /k3os/system ; vi /k3os/system/config.yaml`

I could re-add it (as something like `/var/lib/rancher/k3os/config.d/wifi.yaml`), but, meh.

(doing `sudo mkdir -p /var/lib/rancher/k3os/config.d && sudo  mv /var/lib/rancher/k3os/config.yaml /var/lib/rancher/k3os/config.d/10_hostname.yaml` anyway tho)

I was originally going to keep the wifi online, because I was thinking "oh, two network interfaces on one device, that's simpler than two devices"
