[Here](https://ovid.github.io/articles/alan-kay-and-oo-programming.html) is a fantastic article on what Object-Oriented Programming is *supposed* to enable.

one of the cool points made here: rigorous typesystems are antithetical to a lot of the vision

The "messaging" thing is interesting, it makes the modules in [plumbus][plushu] seem much more like Kay's concept of objects than any of these OOP languages

I've got a whole notebook of complaints about OOP back in my OneNote stuff, so this page will probably expand over time (OOP is the logic of fascism brought to computing, designed to enable capitalist control structures in development processes, which is why you find it most in the most dead-end jobs)
