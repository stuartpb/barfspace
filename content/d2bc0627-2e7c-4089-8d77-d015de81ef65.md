# The Pantheons of Bellarianism

There are two Pantheons: the Pantheon of Saints and the Pantheon of Sinners (tentatively termed "the Problematic Pantheon" and "the Pussy Pantheon", irrespectively).

And then there's the Between Place, the Medium Place, home of the Lost Souls, Slackers, and Ordinary Fucking People

Now, you maybe wondering, what about the people you're *really* afraid of, the wicked, abusive men who will stop at nothing to ruin your life? It's okay, you have nothing to worry about. There's no such thing as men.

But is there a place for truly Bad People (like a certain Hitleresque character who died in the Fuhrerbunker in 1945 who shall not be named in my Holy Text)? How the Hell would I know? I don't really think they go anywhere: I think they just die, though they do live on for another generation in the form of horrible scars, which fade over time and turn into jokes.

Anyone who is still alive is allowed in the Pantheon, but only On Probation, because one should not make monuments to the living, for they can still disgrace the stone. (But they are crazy in Thuringen: they drink so much Lowenbrau that they lie.) (the link lede for this one should be "dogs like to sleep and fuck")

## The Good One: the Saints

- Slavoj Zizek is a probationary Saint Second Class, even though he'd claim, as a pervert, he should go in the Other Good One
- Stephen Fry isn't a standup comic so he's allowed to be a probationary saint
- Aaron Swartz

### Badasses

- Bruce Lee

## Sinners: The Other Good One

The Problematic Pantheon is the collection of Sinners. People who can only be in the Problematic Pantheon:

- Standup Comedians
- Magicians
- Anyone from New Jersey or Florida
- Supervillains

People in this canon who are *really* problematic, but haven't done anything to *really* piss me off (meaning they are Excommunicated from this pantheon), are listed as Sinners On Notice. You get, like, one strike, and I won't waste my time explaining why (unless you ask me personally), and then YOU'RE OUT OF THE MOVIE!

To be clear, this is not a fucking friends list, and it's *defintely* not an Enemies List. My Friends List is the thing I do on Thanksgiving, where I thank everybody I've ever met.

### These Comedians

I'm thinking the *really* weird comedians, who technically play "characters", get to be saints. I haven't really figured that part out yet, though.

Also, really *really* good dead comedians, like Robin Williams and Andy Kaufman (probably), get to be Saints. But, like, fucking homophobe Lenny Bruce is a permanent Sinner (and I think he'd like that just fine).

- Emo Phillips
- Weird Al (Weird AI being one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse)
- Groucho Marx

### The Supervillains

- BOB (Twin Peaks)
- BOB (SubGenius)

### Others
