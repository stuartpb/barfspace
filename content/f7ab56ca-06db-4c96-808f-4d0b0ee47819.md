# kubernetes journey of discovery

## path of the tutorial

massive shoutout to Kelsey Hightower for giving me the giant insight "pods all run on the same host" that is really the thing I needed to start understanding this

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/

## exploring if there's a better way to do images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/ indicates that kubernetes doesn't really disrupt the docker image-registry paradigm, which sucks, and makes one of the current open questions with Plusku ("how should I do build images") all that much harder

Might be possible to just run a registry "in-cluster" a la https://medium.com/@jmarhee/deploying-a-docker-registry-with-persistent-storage-and-local-only-access-on-your-kubernetes-1c6470d3611c

could also do "pre-pulling" for running an image built on the host which just sounds dicey and difficult https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#pre-pulling-images

If there's a better builder than the docker CLI, I don't know it's been built, but this seems to answer my question that Kubernetes has not come up with a better construction method than Dockerfiles

anyway Plusku should probably be using something more like Dockerfiles anyway

also, thinking now, maybe there'll be something like a "CI plugin suite" that has a specified directory to read as the Git root, and all the app plugins

also, new naming paradigm for Plushu: all plugins, instead of being prefixed "plushu", should be prefixed by the "project" whose philosophy they live under. so like the app-image-creation-from-git-hooks ecosystem should be one component, and the deploy-built-image-to-cluster should be another project that, like, kind of incorporates that?

## more exploration of storage for kubernetes

these should probably get their own learning-journey pages:

https://docs.min.io/docs/deploy-minio-on-kubernetes

https://github.com/minio/minio-operator

https://github.com/kubernetes/examples/tree/master/staging/storage/minio

https://rook.io/ (I still can't quite get what this does?)

https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.0/ceph-quickstart.html

https://rook.io/docs/rook/v1.0/k8s-pre-reqs.html#kubeadm

## kubesail corner

also https://kubesail.com/ sounds pretty cool
