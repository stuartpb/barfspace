# The Sincerity of Sloppiness

This is an attempt to consolidate some of the thoughts that have been lingering around in meta-textual messes like [hemingway-style.md][] and [the-thing-about-weird-twitter.md][].

In fact, fuck it, I'm going to go ahead and merge those files into this one.

Actually, no, I'm not going to do that. I'm going to iterate by rewriting what I wrote there, and then deleting (unpublishing) the rougher expressions (leaving them available in the Git history, letting people who want to read obsoleted drafts filter on commits containing the word "delete" and holding any concern for the minute details that may have been lost in the translation as being the definition of "historical interest")... like *actual, honest to god drafts*. Shit, this repo might be making me adopt generally-accepted good writing habits. Shit.

Mania doesn't come naturally to me, and I'm not super comfortable within it. Last Friday, I tried slopping out some text here in barfspace in a manic dash to express myself, and I felt drained, more drained than I necessarily had to.

Keeping things tidy feels *good* to me, in some contexts. It's ironic, because my apartment is always a mess, but my *work*, I can't stand a single stray hair in the logic of.

But I worry that my *natural style* being this semi-rehearsed, practiced, rhythmic thing makes it come off as less raw, more processed, less *trustworthy* than a nigh-inscrutable ee-cummings-style tone poem primal scream where the syntax melts, the words go Humpty-Dumpty, and irony comes and goes as it pleases.

I guess that might be part of the motivation behind what I would feel is "my truth" in barfspace, where I'm just being *me*, in the way that feels most comfortable: it shows that this *is*, in fact, how I roll, how I write off the cuff, how I lay my thoughts out when I'm not trying to obscure anything I already understand.

I don't know: I guess I *did* pause there, writing that last clause, trying to ponder the way to convey the precise sentiment that was on my mind in a way that could be understood.

***But that's who I am.*** Being understood is of the *utmost importance* to the core of my being: the only thing that *really* bothers me is being misunderstood, and I don't know how other people can put up with it. Writing something that could potentially be misunderstood, without taking a minute or less to smooth it out, feels not just *unnatural* to me: it feels *morally wrong*, which is why I was left feeling drained on Friday. It's wrong on the order of using a linear-time algorithm where a constant-time soultion would do: it's putting a burden on a potentially *interminable number of readers* that could have been entirely resolved by *one person* making more of an effort.

And it's not just failing to satisfice: it's not an *infinite* cycke of indecision - indeed, as I've built up this skill, it usually terminates fairly *quickly* (as I said, usually within the course of a minute).

It doesn't really take me that much more time to type with clear spelling, capitalization, and punctuation than it does to hurry, and it leaves me feeling significantly less anxious about what I've written being hard to decipher.
