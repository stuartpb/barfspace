# The Oozy Sewer

Documenting the Worse-is-Better Organic Structuring of These Notes

## description

Here are some more that are explicitly about the structure of these notes - these were originally put on the [Worse is Better index](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) with a note to copy them to [the Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), but then I decided they weren't so applicable to Worse is Better as they were tangential in a link sense.

That thought should probably be made a sibling of these, which also reflect on this intersection:

- [On Semi-Redundant Semantic Trees](027e2a75-4cd7-41c0-90e9-83130e2de0a2.md)
- [Notegraph Optimization](11e55f13-d20c-4816-9e64-41a97bc9847e.md)
- [The Right Wrong Place to Put Things](e927cb21-3a61-4c72-a2a2-6c72fb0b13f5.md)
- [The Two-Layer Rule](da56ea57-e430-4dae-8567-399433172f11.md)
- [The Way the Department Moved](bdfb4f23-78c3-4fe4-a855-527eb02803cd.md)

## How these notes become more

- [the ooze](5db9131a-c60c-4b32-8aa1-5790fb3ef25e.md) talks about how these notes are like proto-code
- [Recursively Knowing What's To Be Done](679a0f00-722b-443a-acb6-83dbe022a3d0.md) touches on the same idea but maybe a little more clearly stated
- [an artifact desiring this page early in development](a493d478-8002-4328-8608-42d09ca38616.md), previously found on [Project Akira](dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md)

## To integrate

- [this page on lifecycles](b5f6a776-5e6f-4386-999a-d4c9c196f67b.md), which was about unrelated pages mutating after falling out of regular familiarization, which interacts with the redundancy of trees as focus drifts - and how sometimes things falling out and becoming fossils is the right way to move on, and how those fossils can become fuel for new content in [pivoting](3f5173cb-34c3-4077-89b2-637624eca32d.md)
- [this Right Now in The Notes page](9d2999b6-8d6d-417b-9a60-36df93a05192.md) has sprouted a huge thing about how pathways also have lifecycles, that should be merged in as well
- [Content As Its Own Identifier](cc4c4ee9-9b10-4ef2-853a-4c2278c4952b.md)

## loose observation of a new technique I'm doing, flow-wise

if I go off on a tangent that I'm not sure how to merge / extricate from a page, I go back to where the page is listed and note other things that are on the page as text

this text can then be reformatted as a link when the page is created - or deleted / moved to a more relevant place

the place that originated the tangent ought to provide a link to it when the tangent moves to its own page, for places where the description leading into the link was only contextual, and needs to be worked into its own link

the various thoughts on [bagtent itself](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) reflect my experience by what kind of design I find myself needing
