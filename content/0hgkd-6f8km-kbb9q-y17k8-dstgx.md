# Worker Space Provisioning Simulator (Mini/meta)Game

A puzzle game where you have to zone a room efficiently enough to survive a wave and proceed to the next level

Could also have this as a "grinding efficiency" system, which ties into some of the ideas I have with [Chao Garden redux](2fhwd-n02q3-2q89d-y7w7s-t23tv)

feels a lot like Little Big Factory
