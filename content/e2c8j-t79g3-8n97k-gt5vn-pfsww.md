# sturling

sturling is the name that has been passed down since my first experiments with Arch Linux (hence the name alluding to Sterling Archer). It is a system based on removable storage, that I take from system to system as available.

This iteration is based on the 32 GB M.2 storage chip I pulled out of my first Chromebook, then bootstrapped from stuzzy.

## spec YAML metadata

the machine-id will probably not be reused when this is rebuilt (see notes below)

```yaml
hostname: sturling
machine-id: f6a77d3a395c491b9c5cfa84add1f0c1
distro: archlinux
processor: x64
chassis: convertible
```

## legacy

there have been a few prior systems using this name:

- [Sturling Mk 1](cns8g-bc9a2-gh8da-v5gpk-9drtv)
- [Sturling Mk 2](e6ysx-99sqk-848ak-6r3ga-k55ts)

## changelogs

If I remember correctly, these plot this mark's effective death in the field by a headassed dd command

a future reinstallation will probably keep this node and mark, but the machine ID will change and it'll be a "new" installation and all.
