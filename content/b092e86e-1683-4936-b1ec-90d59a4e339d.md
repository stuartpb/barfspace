# Slicer-Oriented Dehydrator Trays

As part of the Filament Expansion to Stuworks, I need a mechanism to feed the extruder nice, dry filament.

## Outer Rings

Other parts of this project should include spacer rings that have a space for a hygrometer/thermometer - maybe in such a modular fashion that one could also even potentially introduce Festo fittings

In fact, you could probably expand this out into making something like a six-wedge Basket System

With good enough reinforcement, the rigging for that could even potentially be use

though really, like with drying filament, you probably want at least one stock ring level anyway so you have a stable reinforced middle...

okay, so I guess what I'd do is add a spacer level so each "fryer basket"

## Baskets

So I guess the design I'd want would have a slicer-enforced meshing on the bottom, and then a SCAD-managed perforation pattern (not unlike upstream's slips, though I still don't quite understand their function)

Maybe each wedge is U-shaped, with the outside edge reserved to make room for a lifting "fork" or some other kind of tool that puts a lid on it and picks it up. tbh, I'm thinking infrastructure for 12ths makes a lot of sense - that way, you can track when each batch was intersted by placing slices on the hour of the clock they were added

In fact, if the center is as high as the way the supports are in the included rings, maybe we *don't* need the base ring

anyway, I was thinking, these could be connected using filament

maybe even the first layer can be offset from the one above it, so baskets can straddle lower support (and a 24-hour model can be broken out)?

I'm thinking these should definitely use some kind of friendly snap-together interface, not just between slices but between components - if you print in 12ths and it's reconfigurable, you can easily swap in a hygrometer or spooling system (where you'd need to replace the cores)
