This repo is based on me needing a place to put a few weeds that sprung up in my workspace for [meditations](https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations), where I totally forgot what the aesthetic of the files therein was supposed to be (which is why [I added a note about that shortly before spinning up this repo](https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations/commit/3d5eafe65e662ed2d5802ee8626e81d740699b47)).

The thing about those files is that, beyond the ones that had gone *somewhat* off-course but not to the extent that I hadn't felt comfortable comitting them, I'd basically started writing stream-of-consciousness blog posts, which I hate, because I never know how to finish, and it makes me look like a pompous ass, and I think I even called meditations "where I excrete my thinkpieces" at one point, and ugh that is not what that repo was supposed to be, and this is me fixing that. (I need to finish fixing `meditations`, though, to pull everything that should be *here* out of *there*.)

Honestly, this writing is *good and worth it* (which is why I don't just, you know... not write it), but, I don't know, I never feel comfortable pushing commits for it because they're never finished, or even finished forming a first cohesive point, nothing that'd be solid enough to commit.

Anyway, the reason it's called barfspace is because I intend the bulk of the content to be not in the repo itself, but in the C9 workspace where I continuously compose the files while likely never committing them, because they'll never be truly "ready to commit" (oh great, even my *files* have commitment issues).

update: I ended up writing an auto-commit script that fires every ten seconds if anything changed, which... could be better (ie. not firing until things *stop* changing), but whatever. hahaha it's just like people who deal with their commitment issues by committing way too early and often

The workspace is public, so here's where you can see this freakshow: https://ide.c9.io/stuartpb/barfspace

also maybe I should move this to Glitch

hmm actually that's an interesting point, maybe I'll just make an app that displays the working contents of md files in a Glitch project

anyway that should go in an issue or something, but yah hi this is the repo where everything is a terrible mess

ALSO I'd be remiss if I didn't explicitly shout out Jenn Schiffer here, who makes me feel completely OK with making work that's personal and important but gives zero shits about being polished beyond what I want to convey
