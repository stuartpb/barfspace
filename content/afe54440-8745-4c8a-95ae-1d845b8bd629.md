Doing stuff to recover [my OctoPi installation](5bbc6d64-b33e-4eb4-8280-48509cbcc404.md).

I pulled the MicroSD to do more futzing with it, but, honestly, you know what? I'm just going to wipe the system and reinstall

I'll tar the system to my archive directory so I still have whatever data I might have wanted to save.

Anyway, I'm switching back over to stushiba - this will probably continue in the OctoPi's notes
