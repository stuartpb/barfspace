# Makin' Games

Here's a cavernous, echo-y place where projects can live:

## Tabletop Games

- [Gullibot](6f1da333-f2b2-46d2-a163-84b99db838f4.md)
- Writing the Ship
- [Ultimate Secret Trump](be41a368-ece7-4e79-a3cf-dbfbb6fd4939.md)
- Any number of tabs from my old OneNote notebooks
- A general hub for Shuffled Cards (or maybe that's just what this page is)

## Computer-y games

- [This thing with the Hashblots](70c6cf0c-360c-4f59-959a-663ed81b4751.md)

The impetus to create this page was so that I don't forget https://unpub.net/
