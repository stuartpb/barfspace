# Adventures in 3D Printing

This is a hub for pages that collect my notes on 3D printing in general.

The [Maker][] page covers most of my other notes in this vein: this page is specifically for collecting little pearls of 3D printing knowledge

[Maker]: b2694758-f919-4d46-a29b-7bbf189eab38.md

All of this can eventually get collected into [Everybody Gets a Factory][EGAF], the "Lean Notes of Becoming a Maker", which aims to be a primer to just becoming a person who can build anything they get an idea for physically (the way Lean Notes goes for that, but in web software).

- [Is Prusa Going the Way of Makerbot?](5ce33d60-5385-4aed-a86d-4b46190d6057.md)

## things as I'm learning multi-material printing

## just a little note here since I can't think where I'd rather put it rn

I did the MK3S upgrade for my printer, and I'm a lot less wary of switching filaments now that I'm not terrified of needing to service the extruder (or damaging / not being recognized by the weird fragile flaky filament sensor).

I had a note [in November 2018][emopost] about getting stuck trying to figure out what I wanted to use the current filament with, but this isn't as much of a fret any more.

## material thoughts

weird that https://blog.prusaprinters.org/may-2019-update-original-prusa-sl1-now-shipping-powder-coated-sheets-in-stock-prusaslicer-2-0-and-much-more/ describes the system as having been tested on PETG and CPE when https://toms3d.org/2018/02/05/things-know-petg/ claims they're the same thing and https://filament2print.com/gb/copolyesters-pet/890-cpe-hg100.html says it's "[chlorinated polyethylene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorinated_polyethylene)"?

this should be sorted out in the [Material][] note entry for this

## Ideas for more pages

- Filament Notes, a place to say "this PLA is stringy as hell" and "this black PETG seems more tempermental than my yellow PETG" and stuff like that
  - This is distinct from the [Everybody Gets a Factory Materials page][EGAFM], as that's for *material types in general*, and these would be for documenting *my specific experiences with specific reels of filament*
- How to Make Circuits, explaining all the different ways to hook components up: solder, twisting wires, solder paste, DuPont pins, copper tape, conductive thread... also, you know, traditional PCB fabrication (which you can't generally do yourself at home, making it kind of out-of-scope for EGAF).
  - Meh, I mean, now that I think about it, Everybody Gets a Factory is supposed to be about what's involved in scaling up production, so you can gradually expand / outsource production on a fully-documented trajectory - and could maybe start talking about how to cooperatively and ethically structure material ownership of the means of production as this scales up
  - In other words, this is totally in scope, and this should be worked into that tree as part of the Introduction or something like that
