# Hash visualization

This is a little place in my notes for [hashblot](https://hashblot.com/) and [hashsplat](https://hashsplat.com/)

[Blotpass](https://unusual.studio/projects/#17fc1b1d-52de-4e84-96eb-bf20bd18212a) should arguably have its own page, but since it's more evolving into a feature of NilPass, the node identifier can live here for now

## Projects incorporating

- NilPass, eventually
- [This game thing for cracking mnemonics](e33cy-31p1k-ts9b6-k67vc-1phth)

## Advantages of Hashblot

- Simpler implementation (doesn't need gradients, blend modes)

## Advantages of Hashsplat

- Handles more complex hashes
- More image elements allowing for more expressive visualizations
