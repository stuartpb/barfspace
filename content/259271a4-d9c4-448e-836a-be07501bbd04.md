# Making the UUIDs Base32

I threw this little scriptlet together:

```bash
base32rfc=ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
base32_dc=0123456789abcdefghjkmnpqrstvwxyz
(for c in `bin/bagtent-mkuuid | sed s/-//g | sed -e 's/../& /g'`; do printf "\x$c"; done) | base32 | tr $base32rfc $base32_dc
```

## knowing your base 32

- https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid-base32
- https://github.com/gas-buddy/uuid-base32
- https://github.com/solsson/uuid-base32
  - the docs all say base 62 though

the real one other than Crockford is [RFC 46448](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4648)

that specifies two base32 variants, both of which have a significant flaw relative to Crockford (while sharing some of the strengths):

- base32 (rfc)
  - strengths:
    - supports the *entire* alphabet without 1/I or 0/O ambiguity
      - still has the ambiguity of l and i (or 1), and U and V
      - and the possibility of words with "U" in them
    - also doesn't have 8/b ambiguity (removes digits 0, 1, 8, and 9)
    - useful if you want to write a Bacon cypher
      - though [Extended Bacon 5-Bit Character Set](f8b21817-e4ad-4971-a1c3-11548cd5b643.md) is a better use of the last 6, IMO
  - cons:
    - doesn't sort asciibetically due to numbers coming at the end
    - not compatible with base16
    - doesn't even support all digits
- base32 hex
  - strengths:
    - sorts asciibetically
    - isomorphic with hexadecimal
  - weaknesses:
    - alphabet ends early
    - 1/I and 0/O ambiguity are still here

## the alphabets for tr

```
base32rfc ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ234567
base32hex 0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUV
base32-dc 0123456789ABCDEFGHJKMNPQRSTVWXYZ
```

## reflecting on the check digit

- https://www.crockford.com/base32.html
  - I do not like that character set choice one bit
  - `-_.+u` would have been more URL-safe, right?
    - but I guess the idea is to be distinct?
    - hmm, I guess you could use the check digit as a *leading* character in, like, transmission, that would be cool
      - would narrow down false positives for a given prefix by a factor of 5, right?
  - Anyway, I should have a Notes/Reaction page to Crockford's Base32
