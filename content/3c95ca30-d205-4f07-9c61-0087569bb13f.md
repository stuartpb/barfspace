# Thoughts on the jurisdictional duties of the Beyonder Consulate

Old GitHub structure doesn't count, that's just an adjunct operation within the mainline historian duties (though that will probably be a focus of the how-i-roll Trapper Keeper work)

This will probably start a joint venture with History Force for documenting archaeology into older note structures like OneNote and Trello

The Beyonder Consulate always has a close relationship/rivalry with [Operation Trapper Keeper](1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md), which wants to integrate notes, and especially those in foreign historic predecessors: having the Beyonder Consulate do a thorough documentation job makes it easier to pass off to The [Notegraph Historium](c4ab1f6b-cac2-4025-ae27-3b82f0a9d4c6.md) without having to go through [Archaeology Force](eaaac719-db0f-4eeb-8d5d-bc1bcac57c82.md)
