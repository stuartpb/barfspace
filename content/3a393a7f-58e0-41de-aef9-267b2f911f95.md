# Collaborative/Collective Content Containers

This is a hub for [project seed ideas](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) I have that are like a wiki or forum or whatever.

Some of them may fall under [My Old Bad Ideas](f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md), and may be accomplishable with [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) in some fashion

in rough order of message-versus-medium-oriented nature of the idea (from message to medium):

- [timetress](0f7c0d76-21f0-4ad1-aed0-d81402293359.md)
- [Universal Issue Tracker](1305adb9-59a7-4179-a9fe-0ddedd802034.md)
- [DingRoll](859dcb46-898c-4650-acad-0ab788d004a2.md)
- [Squorum (boxesin redux)](80c01468-5a12-4496-90f0-64abad259156.md)
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline](a4698628-2fba-4d14-9f31-72b8e9688445.md)
- [Casettic](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md), the Sparse File in the Sky
  - this can also be thought of like a one-dimensional Squorum with stricter scarcity
- Clubs, an event aggregator and incubator
- [passback](f9cc032a-e72a-4243-884c-73a38fb0603a.md)

## sort of like this

- [editor-related concepts](52a91c72-061a-4d6f-8018-b3e86351c0d5.md) tend to tackle tools that could be used for stuff like some of the above (especially when structed as bagtent) from a single-user point of view
- [concepts for communities](cbf8b20c-fd72-4c42-a543-952e046c893b.md) is specifically oriented around the orgs, with the shared content base as a usually-secondary concern
  - the Network Neighborhood quests linked from there sometimes go here, but are mostly closer to there

## possible litmus test for this page vs. Community Wishlist

Can it be instanced, or is there only one reasonable application of this tool to a community?
