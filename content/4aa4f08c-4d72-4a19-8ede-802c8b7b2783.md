# Restructuring Markdown

(originally split out from [How Lists Form In My Notes](0a6f59fb-6b6d-41a8-aa25-372a5e3f9d5e.md))

- like, really, this is starting to shape up to "things that a linter / editing tool would catch / provide UI affordances / hot-tip tool for"
  - another thought in this vein: "one sentence mode".
    - all lines are enforced to contain one sentence (ie. any dots)
    - doing a parenthetical at the end of a line like that last one would be disallowed
    - I'd like to make an exception for ending a line with a one-word reaction, like this one. yeah
      - that also makes it almost TAP compatible
      - also works as a truck for emoji reactions
        - you could even have them auto-hidden
          - this is starting to overlap with constructions I was thinking of for Dingroll
      - you could do multi-character... I'm thinking one-word "tags", really
        - in DingRoll I said "messages that are one-word strings of 4 or fewer characters"
          - but now I'm realizing, holy hell that would work amazingly as a Tumblr-esque / Twitter-esque "tagging" method
            - haha, this would make end-of-line hashtags
          - but yeah, I think this is more just "cool ways the DingRoll tagging system could operate"
            - posting with a hashtag like this basically retweets a message to another tag,
              - and it shows up like a quoted tweet, or, like, a Slack react... I mean, it'd be as a "Faces +X gave reaction Y"
          - but yeah...
            - okay, maybe this is me caving to "threading in DingRoll!" requests...
              - but hey, Lua 5.2 gave in to "break as a loop construct" AND "have goto at all"
                - and hopefully this expansion
              - but Replies can be another class of post in DingRoll (or whatever system this could be).
                - they naturally parent to a comment, and inherit its tags
                - wait, can't you just have the parent comment become a tag? and then "reply" puts it in its filter?
                  - and can take it off to make its context "reply-only", ie, not copying the channel
                    - this would allow admins to go "okay guys take it to a thread"
                      - continues under the "oh snap, what about DingRoll" heading
        - actually, remember, multi-character is the way to express many emoji constructs
    - a kind, polite way to implement this would be to, like, map the construction of a new sentence to the creation of a new list item, like this:
      - once the user has typed a dot, a space,
      - IMPORTANT NOTE THOUGH: You'd need to have some way to cancel easily and quickly and maybe automatically by a rule
        - Another thought though, and this ties into a broader theme in UI design: these "don't activate the feature" carveouts
          - And you can't just throw AI at this, either. It's better if it's something the user can either easily adjust, or adjust to
            - If they constantly need to second-guess the machine under circumstances that shift, it's more frustrating than jsut doing it transparently
    - another angle to consider refactorization: Lines Beyond the Right Margin
      - like, in tandem with the last idea, you could have that be the "kill line", where, if you have a dot at the end of your sentence and it's not, like, backslash-escaped (remember, that's totally cool under the normal parse rules of Markdown!) - o
- and sometimes it's just a need to parenthetisize or break up a run-on sentence
- think of it as structuring statements in a post-paragraph format
  - or "thoughts"
- sometimes a
