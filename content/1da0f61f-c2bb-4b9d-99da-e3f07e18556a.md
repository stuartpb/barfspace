# Operation Trapper Keeper

This is now the main note under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] for the continuing work of integrating outside content that began with [Project Akira][]. It's kind of a cursor for where a bunch of legacy work is at: a base camp to address newer developments in while trying to disassemble incomplete thoughts from a different time into pieces of a newer world, for structures from before the notes started coming in.

[Project Akira]: dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md
[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

I guess this could also be thought of as a sort of Ellis Island, a receiving port for outside content, since so much of it pertains to integrating material from my pre-merger writings.

For more information on things I'm struggling with in these notes, check the [News][] (though notes-news hasn't been authored so much lately as of early-June 2019, with more attention haivng been given to projects that are described here writing their plans in the spots where they're gonna be implemented - possibly a side-effect of this Department's infrastructure having developed out a bit, with abstract zones popping up like Camp Papalima and How-i-roll's Tomb to work like meta pages that can shift in focus between different "teams").

## Continuing operations

A History Force, developing a more robust archaeological infrastructure, inspired by a reread of the notes on Project Akira, has been moved to [how-i-roll's Tomb][])

[how-i-roll's Tomb]: bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md

History Force will continue to review [non-historical comments on [the standing Project Akira page](dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md), and work with the standing contingent of Opkeepers to integrate cut content that's still relevant into locations elsewhere in the Tree (maybe commissioning new branches under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] to address unresolved points), and summarize / artifact the content that has a place in understanding the history there (remembering that non-summary versions of stuff that wasn't clear can be read through history, if there's "forensic" need to review exact wording).

[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

The continuing integration of petlogs is tracked at the outpost at [Camp Papalima](4f705b65-cc3c-4f66-a256-ae5e5777d276.md).

## Other remaining integrative work

Migrated from [the page that now lists divisions](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md):

- [lingering tasks from after Project Akira](19189561-a743-4129-98ac-639817e09911.md)
  - [the planfile postmortem](f359a1e5-3e4f-4d30-8be3-0d0635c77ea4.md) still needs to be integrated better (TO DO: Work with History Force)
  - See the "detritus" below for what should become a dedicated Planfile Archaeological Expedition note
- "Packing up the Old World", apart from the planfile stuff (which is *kind of* done?), is now *done* done (and has been deleted, since its remaining task descriptions were just redundant and confusing).
- Whether to merge or bolster [what's left in other repos](c139f558-e2a2-416d-9144-e101a9218820.md)
- There was a note about codifying the structure of Quests that I think is handled better elsewhere now.

## detritus from earlier incarnations of this page

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

There ought to be a page specifically on the role of Right Now going forward (wow, that is a meta-sounding sentence)

UPDATE: I think this'd be the Planfile Postmortem - which needs to remember that I still need to go back and retrieve dead items that amy be of interest *from the Git history*, since there was a point where I was like "I'll delete anything I'm not working on, and the only way to find it will be by searching history, that'll make things easier than keeping a hierarchy".

Reminder that there's a note on Project Akira about reviving Right Now, pull from that when splitting this off to its own page (which I tried to do but Gitpod started acting up)

should probably get consolidated into / around [this page reflecting on the old planfile](f359a1e5-3e4f-4d30-8be3-0d0635c77ea4.md)
