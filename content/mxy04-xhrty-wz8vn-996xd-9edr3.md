# What is computing?

One of the biggest misconceptions around what constitutes a "computer" in the modern era is that the act of "computation" is something tangible- namely, that it's an *electric* phenomenon. (You could put something like the Weird Science "computer gets struck by lightning -> hot lady comes out" techno-woo here to illustrate magical thinking around the physical nature of computers.)

The reality is that "computer programming" is an abstract concept, and it always has been. In the 1800s, Charles Babbage designed a Difference Engine that would be capable of performing complex calculations through a series of gears, screws, and swords (yes, *swords!*) The Curta calculator is another example of a physical calculator from the pre-electronic era; before that, we had the abacus and slide rule.

Now, those are all computers for *math*, and I was saying in the Preface that we wouldn't be focusing on math. What about something else that a computer can do that's not immediately mathy, like playing Tic-Tac-Toe? Well, in 1975, students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology [built a Tic-Tac-Toe-playing computer entirely out of wooden sticks and spools][Tinkertoy Computer]: that same logic can be found in book form as the [Tic Tac Tome][], or even just on a poster of [this XKCD page][xkcd 832]. None of these are any less a "computer" or "program" or "artificial intelligence" than a "computer player" you might play the game against on your phone or desktop; they're all just different representations of the same rules, the same way as "2" or "two" or "II" all represent the same number.

Now, this might seem like a needless rhetorical flourish, but it's important to note, because the origins of computer programming lie *directly* in these pre-electronic concepts of code. The earliest programming languages were theoretical constructs for papers: formal, unambiguous language, represented by symbols/punctuation for brevity, to express ideas. Possibly the earliest definition of a theoretical machine code was that used by Alan Turing (blah blah blah this is boring rewrite this)

(TODO: Describe [ALGOL][], and how Lisp was another theoretical language before someone went and made an interpreter for it)

The constructs of modern computer programming really solidified in the era of computer labs in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of the ideas in programming can have a kind of zen-koan-like abstractness to them: this is probably why [so many of the people who drove the computer revolution were hippies][SPACEWAR].
