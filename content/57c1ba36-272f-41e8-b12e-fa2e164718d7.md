# Gearing Up for a Real Cluster

This was the first iteration of Stubernetes to span a machine beyond the Chromebook, when I realized trying to run everything off of 2 cores was going to be somewhat tricky.

## anyway here we go again

- [Preliminary Notes](853a7b4f-9ae2-4a98-98cc-13cdc181cf7b.md)
  - original plan outline
    - note that divergences started fairly quickly in the deployment process
  - Includes rationale for using Rook (and not OpenEBS)
    - OpenEBS's CPU needs having been the point of failure for the previous revision was part of the rationale
      - Ceph may not necessarily end up being any better, but we'll see, and putting it on a Pi means we'll be ready
    - not needing iscsid running on the host is another big one
      - Rook just seems better-suited in general, especially on Kubic

- [Initial Stubernetes setup](bb2da941-b57c-49e2-a3dc-4982f6636409.md)
  - wipefs on devices
  - labeling nodes for Ceph
  - rolling out Helm Operator
- [The next wave](58472f06-bcef-4a12-9f88-32a70b757302.md)
  - rolling out metallb successfully
  - needed to move the helm operator to the x64 node
  - this was when I untainted studtop for assignment
    - and when I realized the next iteration would want a Pi for the master node
  - got household-dns running
    - needed to fix some problem in my yaml
- somewhere around here I rolled out [Stuplink](410e7121-5903-47fb-9341-5126c72cae60.md)
- [A Screeching Halt](1a49d297-be30-40f7-9c79-2d2548ce86ce.md)
  - everything fails at once
  - I resolve to come back to this project again in a month after there's been another release cycle or two
