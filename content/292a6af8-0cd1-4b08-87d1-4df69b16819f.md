# The Great Bell Curve of Greater Saints

## Saint Columbo

A seeming fool who used culprits' willingness to underestimate him to uncover their weaknesses. Lieutenant Columbo is one of the great Bellarian Detectives.

## Saint Monk

A man with a Holy Name who is cursed with the Great Aneristic Meta Disorder.

## Saint Detective Pikachu

Like Columbo, but cuter. Detective St. Pikachu is the patron saint of trying to conduct an investigation, only to be hampered by people who think you're too cute to be investigating anything.

## Saint Sherlock Holmes

As a public-domain Saint, Sherlock is one of the most reincarnated of all (much like Dracula, one of the Lesser Devils of Bellarianism).

And I'm not even *talking* about the Falls.

## The Pantheon of Make-Believe

Everybody who ever visited the Neighborhood of Make-Believe on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is a Greater Saint, including Big Bird (although Big Bird is technically a "Green Card Saint").
