# stuartpb On Security

Where I put all the stuff I've been wanting to say about security and auth systems design for years, but have been to scared to say (because it's mostly just co-opting the tone of everybody else who writes in the infosec space, with zero practical/firsthand experience or evidence to back it up).

Note that these files were never actually comitted to the stuartpb on Security repo, and as such may actually be incomplete in their currently comitted form (in fact, I'm sure that at least two of these have at least one incomplete sentence each):

- A [proposal for a talk at SeattleJS called "Verif Morghulis: All Passwords Must Die"][Verif Morghulis] that I never ended up posting
- [In a Perfect World: My Dream Identity Management System][dream-iam], a long-winded and not-yet complete essay that should probably be broken out into separate pages under the Lean Notes model
- [Best Practices For Implementing, You Know, Everything on the Web][bp], another section that appears (from the way it has a symbol for `[2]` and the previous file has a `[1]`) to have been split out from the previous item (because "my dream system" doesn't really care about implementation details)
- A little bit about [Lockout and Breach][], currently titled "The Perils of Too-Heavy Protection"
