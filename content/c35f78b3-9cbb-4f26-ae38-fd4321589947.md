# dockitall

## plan

new "thickness of case around plug" variable, for raising the plug a bit beyond the tip

make "phone cross-section" module, which gets offset to form the vertical walls of the dockblock (which are then extruded)

consists of hull of back and front corner circles with a front and back radius

facing forward the body of the block can be a linear extrusion too (unified with the walls)

extend the dockblock to the current hacky prism's base so it'll now be just cut under the Z axis

make the triangle a hull of "front-facing corner radius" circles

have "just the plug" and "belt/ring for around case" printable draft test piece modules derived from some of the above structure

front, back, and sides are also implemented as 2D shapes: walls are designed as intersections between the ring/belt top-down silhouette described above and the front / back halves of the block

front can now be curved - start as square, then do speaker knockout by differencing the hull of some circles. You can difference circles from the negative to round corners more

curving around the screen's corners contours would be cool, and making the back have rounded corners like the phone itself (while the wall around curves too) would be cool, but those *side* corners are what *really* need to be rounded

ofc there's striping but that's already done
