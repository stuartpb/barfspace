# notestack Sprint With Anxiety 2K19

I need to make progress on [The Shotclock and Integrity](vwjtn-pkzhg-gc9ff-2h6sj-nddpy) if I want to be able to use these notes again without feeling like I'm investing in a big time bomb of local-machine-failure (per my current working decision to punt and use VS Code on stushiba for [Closing Time](pz3ey-e0160-wvanm-a0xcr-tv94w))

- [x] set up npm infra in bagtent repo
- [x] install remark stuff
- [x] write bagtent-distance
- [x] figure out how to do script that will tell which names from distance aren't in the tree
- [ ] integrate "pause on test failure" to git shotclock
