# Barfspace Ongoing Legacy Upkeep Quests

Quests for the Upkeep of Barfspace's Ongoing Legacy (QUBOL)? Still workshopping a name, really.

Part of the [Department of Barfspace][DoB].

[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

This is the list of quests around modernizing legacy content in these notes, including outside content that should be merged in, as well as merging old pages that have been superseded by new pages, that sort of thing. (This was originally termed "Operations", but I'm leaning away from that name these days because it's a little vague, vs. ie. the actual operations required to sustain the project's technical implementation.)

## Swallowing the Planfile

There was good stuff in the stuartpb.plan file that got abandoned in early 2018. Bring it on board here.

- [ ] Keep updating [the postmortem / notes page for this quest][planfile postmortem].
- [ ] Create new quest material / other pages here for the existing stuff on there.
- [ ] Deprecate / archive the old repo.

## Packing Up the Old World

Barfspace has essentially grown to encompass most of the previous failed projects I'd meant to do writing on.

Now, it's going to going to expand to encompass [the entirety of my loose writing as one big mass][GMP]. (Note that a major quest that would otherwise be on this page has been moved to that one: the two are somewhat inextricably linked in this way.)

[GMP]: f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md

- [ ] Complete "Swallowing the Planfile".
- [x] Finally go back and revisit the [My Old Bad Ideas][] page.
  - This is how we got the [Project Akira][] holding page with the redundant quests that eventually merged back over to here.
- [x] Figure out a litmus test for the difference between Meditations and Musings, or merge the former (in Lean Notes) into the latter (here).
  - Musings and Meditations were merged into [this page][Musitations].
- [x] Merge pitches-and-scripts into here, where it's less embarassing (since there's a sort of ambient embarassment about the place here).
- [x] Make sure all the Lean Notes issues are copied into pages in Barfspace before archiving the repo or whatever.
- [ ] Merge in [Understanding Lua][].
- [ ] Take some territory from [petlogs][].
  - [x] Make a page for [broken things][].
  - [ ] Move whatever papercut notes are in petlogs to that page
  - [ ] a weird thing is that I only feel comfortable capitalizing machine names, which wouldn't count case-sensitive against the hostname, here in barfspace where there's no expectation of structure at all
- It's worth exploring why I've become more ready to use a system like this instead of one of the things I've used in the past like Issues or Trello
  - [ ] A lot of the stuff I did in weird Issues... now that I'm really starting to get bored with GitHub, I'm regretting the close ties to GitHub Issues, and am probably going to start migrating some of this design stuff into these notes.

## Merging Versus Supporting Existing Works

Revisiting https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/2, the list from when things were first being merged into [Lean Notes][] (when bagtent was first being devised), there are still some old repos that should probably get a presence in these notes.

Most of these that haven't been merged in yet will probably get sprouted off the [Concept Lab][] page

- [ ] FLOC Estimation
- [ ] stuartpb-loadout
  - [ ] Maybe have a note page describing how I generally roll these days, loadout-wise.
- [ ] Manual of Style
  - This was, itself, just an offshoot from 
- [ ] github-mistakes
- [ ] CouchDB in a Hurry
  - [ ] Start a note page for issues-like deliberation on this: I'm satisfied leaving the doc as its own repo for now.
- [ ] The SACRED Properties should probably get explored more in these notes before I try to spin a whole website out for them.
- [x] stuartpb-exit-codes was already kicked into the shitpostsphere
- [x] waxhead-revisited was likewise moved into barfspace
- [ ] The Plates of GATEs thing should probably get some kind of page in these notes, and probably be un-repoified... unless the template is in there already, in which case, eh whatever.
- [ ] What even *is* stuart-explains?
- [x] HOARD Guidelines should really move to here, unless, like GATEs, it has templates in the repo (which tbh it should)
  - I've made a stub for it [here][HOARD] - let me check if I ever actually wrote anthing...
  - Nope! Nothing in the C9 workspace. I did write up a little thing explaining my procedure for packing for trips, but I'll throw that into a separate page.
  - I did make label templates for it, but they were pretty simple, and I'm realizing now that the label approach was a bad idea. This one can somewhat be chalked up to falling apart the way so many of [My Old Bad Ideas][] have
  - Repo deleted, workspace destroyed - it's officially absorbed into the notes. Huzzah.
- [ ] three-js-ways-to-do-it should be moved to here and deleted as a repo since it never got content
  - [ ] If I ever start making content, a repo will probably be called for since it'll probably have a lot of code
- [ ] date-rosetta can probably continue to live as a repo but will need a notes page (the Projacronym/Concept-Lab page alludes to a "Shadow notes" nexus at some point, that'd be where those notes would fork from)
- [ ] Gullibot and Writing the Ship should move into notes
- [ ] help-wanted should be absorbed into the notes

## Stuff to do now that the notes are all in one repo

- [ ] Update https://github.com/stuartpb/collected-writings
- [ ] Spin down the Lean Notes brand? At this point, the org has no repos: I honestly might as well just delete it, archive the lean-notes repo (noting in the repo description that it was merged here), and redirect leannotes.com to stuartpb.com
- [ ] Actually start moving the Trello stuff to Lean Notes pages
- [ ] Write up an explanation of what the hell is going on
- [ ] Figure out what barf.space should have on it now.
  - [ ] How about a stub repo on GitHub?
    - the README can tell the story of Project Barfspace, and how it turned into my notes
    - it can then link to [the old barfspace readme node][OBRN], which is now the hub for a few pages that point toward what Barfspace is meant to embody within those notes
- [ ] Figure out what to do with all these lingering references to "barfspace" around.
  - [ ] They can probably turn into links to that old readme node, which has links to stuff like [the name explainer page][] and [Project Akira][] that might make it clearer (or muddier, whatever).

## Dividing Up the New World

I guess this'll probably be the canonical Sisyphean labor for not just trying to give structure to barfspace, but to track the giving of that structure.

- [ ] Carry out some of the plans from the [Department of Development][dept]
- [x] Split each arc into its own page, this page is starting to get too long and unruly. That'll also allow for more meta-structure around arcs (hooray, meta-structure!)
  - As we split out, diaspora OK? Quests becoming just a convention that's pervasive through all notes? That'd be cool to me
    - [ ] There should probably be an explainer for the form of Quests.
      - [ ] Start rounding up musings around Quests that have been spread around the notes and dumping them into [The Plan Plan][Project Akira].
- [ ] Set up a private bagtent tree for notes that should remain unpublished and private.
  - [ ] Figure out what'd be an appropriate way to distribute this.
    - [ ] Keep a master repository in an encrypted repo on a USB stick on your router-server?
      - [ ] Complete the "Flash Open-Source Router Firmware" quest (which I don't think I've written up yet) to unlock this path.
    - [ ] Keep it on your desktop, and just try to keep it booted into Linux forever?
      - [ ] Unlock the "Booting Stutendo Under Stushiba" tech to make this a more feasible idea.
  - [ ] See note about Blackbeard's treasure currently on Loose Notes.
