# Mozilla jobs

[all remote jobs](https://careers.mozilla.org/listings/?location=Remote%20US) (Mozilla doesn't have a Seattle office)

the below positions aren't around any more but I guess I'll keep these notes around in case they come back?

## Technical Content Manager

This [Technical Content Manager](https://careers.mozilla.org/position/gh/1442762/) position looks *spectacular*.
  - I should review [these guidelines](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/governance/policies/participation/) and maybe polish up a newer, nicer response to that one Mozilla bug about infinite loops on Windows (even though the dev who replied to my message was totally being a prick).

Five samples I could put:

- My Cracked articles
- CouchDB In a Hurry (and maybe CouchDB: A Serious Datastore on Serious Earth)
- The Chatroom of Requirement (might need a little more polish? Can't remember how far I got with this)

## Add-ons Engineer

[This job](https://careers.mozilla.org/position/gh/1589555/) also looks cool (and especially relevant right now as I port my extensions to Firefox).
