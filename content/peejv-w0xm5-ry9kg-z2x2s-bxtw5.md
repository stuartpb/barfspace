# The Quest for a Bagtent-Suitable Markdown Editor

Some of this is a quest for an existing tool that's capable of [the Bagtent Publisher I described here](gmq14-az5nx-wa9kj-9hm78-1t24g)

## Netlify CMS

https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms

This might work as an editor interface for these notes. If not the interface itself (Bagtent presents an admittedly unusual use case, and it doesn't seem that this is built for wiki-style content), then at least the backend parts of Netlify CMS can be reused.

More thoughts on the identity side of this (for own-work implementation) in [this separate note](xkt4h-5qx1g-0a9ka-dp93t-k3440)

## Other editors

- [Dillinger](https://dillinger.io/)
  - doesn't follow inter-document links
  - Could probably be added via patch?
  - doesn't seem to have whole-session export
  - would probably choke on thousands-of-documents scale
- https://dokie.li/
