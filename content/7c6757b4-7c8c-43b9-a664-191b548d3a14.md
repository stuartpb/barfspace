# Let's Encrypt for Internal Names

One thing I've been turning over is if I might want to give a global namespace (ie. one with a TLD) for cluster-internal service, just so Let's Encrypt can find it and give certificates?

I mean, Traefik handles this? or cert-manager? idk, I think cert-manager might be needed for this. Food for thought - possible next steps.
