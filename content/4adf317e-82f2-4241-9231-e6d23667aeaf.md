# Big Works in Progress

## [exit codes][]

Documentation for the standard reasons I'd exit a thread (read: conversation).

You know that thing where someone's just being incredibly tedious and awful, so you just want to walk away? This is for that, except the idea is that you can drop a hyperlink to help them better understand *why* they're being tedious, and what they could do to *not* be tedious in the future.

## [Waxhead Revisited][]

A gonzo walkthrough for cheesy 90s FMV point-and-click adventure game [Are You Afraid of the Dark? The Tale of Orpheo's Curse](http://orpheoscurse.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tale_of_Orpheo's_Curse), to give me an outlet for florid prose for when I'm feeling nostalgic and/and drunk.

## [western-civilization-walkthrough.txt][walkthrough]

This is supposed to be a joke in the vein of the [GameFAQs walkthrough for Problem Sleuth](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&p=000816) (maybe crossed with [this t-shirt](https://www.topatoco.com/bestshirtever/)), where it gives the "strategy" for "winning" at various points in human civilization. 90% of the "strategies" are basically "be born in the right place at the right time", and the rest is "commit atrocities on indigineous peoples for 9/10 of the game, then symbolically atone at the last minute so you can claim reparations are uncalled for".

### Progress

Yeah, since I just told you the punchline, why bother to write the joke?

I think the point I was originally trying to make with this is that "ahead of its time" is a thing, and how, for instance, you wouldn't make it very far trying to be an oil tycoon in the 1700s. That said, if there's any real value to be had in this premise, I'm pretty sure I'm not going to be the one to find it.
