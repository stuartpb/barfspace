# What's New with Stuart P. Bentley

This is going to be the flip side of [Right Now][]: documenting the history of what's *happened* that's *around* that state, day-to-day life stuff that gives context to what I'm up to, but isn't critical to understanding it - things like that. (In [postmortem][] terms, this was stuff I had in my planfile before, and it was one of the things that I felt made it eventually get too burdensome to maintain at a consistent level) Tonally, I'm expecting this to be more of a touchy-feely checkins kinda space.

Another way of maybe looking at it: this is where the sneak previews of what might pop up in Right Now will be, because I'll write about thinking about it here.

Structurally, I'm thinking I'll kind of structure it by, like, "episode" of stuff that I want to write about:

- End of September 2018: [The Week Before the Weddings][2018W39]
- [Halloweek 2018][]
