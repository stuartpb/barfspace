## Nearby and overlapping

- [On Conjuring without a Root in Mind](gc2g6-srcg4-rvaxs-5kz3d-ekp8r)
  - talks a bit about how bin/validate could be slightly-tweaked as a form of "sweep bag"
    - especially with Automatic Link Titling
      - though it could just be a simple `head -n 1 | sed s/^#//` type deal in a processing script
        - maybe you could call it "summarize-orphans"
          - heck, that'd probably be really good just as a body to copy from
          - TODO: write this script, an extension of `bin/validate`

## Well, I say no reason...

As I start to open up a lot of files, it becomes really hard to tell the buffers apart. Keeping them all in "one linear buffer" makes it easy to jump between them

Ahh, this may be where the "[Bagtent Accordion Presentation](n3ht7-s55td-078sn-zx3ny-z0b0q)" idea came from...
