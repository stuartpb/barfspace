# Trying to explain the model

A Kubernetes cluster is a space that implements the definition you give it.

You define your state using:

- [Pods](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/)
  - Pods are the Kubernetes construct for Containers
  - Generally defined as templates in Controllers
    - creating a Pod directly is for one-off runs and things like that
  - they represent all the processes that might make up a "piece" that could run on its own machine
  - this'll frequently just be one container
  - sometimes you'll need multiple containers
    - like if, say, your "server" consists of a lower-level server that is wrapped by a higher-level server
    - all containers in a pod share the same network interface (IP and ports)
  - [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/#alternatives-considered) explains why Pods well
