# stushiba mk 1

This is a pretty sparse set of changes, from what was (presumably, based on said sparseness) a pretty short-lived desktop installation of Arch Linux.

I think there might be further documentation from this system around on a flash drive somewhere, but I don't believe it was ever put up on Gist.
