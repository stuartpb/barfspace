I dob't like losing work, which is why I like Git, but also I don't want to do the whole cutting-commits thing, and I don't want auto-comitting

or actually, though, do I? like that might honestly just be the thing to do, set up a Cron job that just commits if there's uncommitted changes, and adds all files

well okay though the thing is, I don't want to have buffer saving as a step, if that's what I'm doing

but I guess I could just turn on auto-save in this workspace

ok done, now the next step would be the cron script thing
