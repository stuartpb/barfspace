This is a tree-style navigation structure for bagtent, a cross between the existing breadcrumb navigation spec and Tree Style Tabs.

Every "next level" navigation can be represented as a tree, and its "ancestry" from the root can be collapsed to one level

every page can be "pinned", which means that it'll stay visible in the list even when its parent is collapsed

"pinned" is represented with an eye, though, because what it means is "open tab"

if a page is opened at multiple points in the tree, it gets a "warp cycle" button that moves the "actively displayed tab"

there still needs to be an "other parents" option that I guess opens siblings of parents as such, and creates such an aforementioned "warp cycle item" to open?

TODO: See if I had a different note about breadcrumb navigation? I feel like I did
