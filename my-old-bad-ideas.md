It's funny: the consistent theme of all these bad ideas is that I was convinced that the thing inhibiting my creativity was the lack of a venue for it.

Though, actually, come to think of it... was I wrong? I mean, that's essentially what it took: look at how my output *exploded* once I found Cloud9.

So I guess it's actually kind of sad.
