It's this sheen everybody trying to predict the future strived for.

> *It felt so real...*

Plastic, smooth, rounded at the sides, in an empty, infinite space. It's how the computers rendered it - the Platonic Ideal. We were all heading closer and closer to a computed ideal - the Perfect Mall at the End of the Universe.

When you're a kid, you want to place yourself in the narrative of the world around you. It forms the basis of your memory: how it's constructed. Suspension of disbelief. When you go to Epcot, you don't think about the junkie by the side of the road you saw coming into the park. They meant you to shield your eyes from that. *That's not going to be something you'll need to concern yourself with as an adult. It'll all be fixed in a few years. You'll never need to have known.*

And yet, there was always something creeping at the corners, a sense of incompleteness, dirt, chaos. The dissonance between our desire to believe in this illusion, our collective disbelief, and the realization that, if this *was* what the future was going to look like... what would be linking it all up? In [The Mind's Eye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmE4IWPaULE), were we due for a world of unicycling robots? Dancing robots? Dinosaurs? These visions do not reconcile.

Zizek talks about Santa Claus, and our clean, endlessly uniform future where buildings are auto-generated was that. The adults knew it was all a scam, on some level; but did they? Were they just coked up out of their minds?
