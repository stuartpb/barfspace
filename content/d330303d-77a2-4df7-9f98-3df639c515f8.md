A thing I wrote on a note where I made the title and started writing a tangent, then forgot what I was writing when I came back later:

> This is the thing with ADHD, you can get lost because you're already operating under the conception of months of groundwork that exist in your head but have not yet been laid

I think the direction I was going in here was "and when your access to that groundwork vanishes for whatever reason, the things you wrote make no sense without that context"
