# Drag-Screw Enclose/Escape UI Gesture

So, thinking about a tabbed window system, and how you might want to "open" a group

you could have the cursor "walking a dog", which is this little circle on a leash

and if you want to do the open/close gesture, you just make a circle around the dog

hah, what if this was training for an "invisible dog", where you're just doing these cursor gestures without the UI illustration of the underlying engine
