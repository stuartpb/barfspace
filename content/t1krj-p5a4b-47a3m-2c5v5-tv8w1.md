# Avenue 5 Scene Idea

something goes wrong in the ship's insides and Bobby has to go fix it, and the passegers, idiots as always, come in and try to oust her

so this is a maybe food-hydrator-sized power conduit? (totally pulled a "look around the room" for the scale of this one)

or a bus of these, so it's a bit of back-and-forth to wrap *all* of them in tape

and they're like "We want the AC back on, and she's LITERALLY covering it in red tape!" "Uh, yeah, because I want people to know this is the POWER bus?!"

anyway, they go haul her off into a committee, and cheer as they "tear down this red tape!" (whatsisname, who was a spider, that guy, maybe leading that), and while she's "in hearing" (which is basically just a non-stop airing of grievances), someone who's whatever Avenue 5's engineering's version of a redshirt is comes and plugs ground into the (unlabeled, and thus its natural black, signifying ground) power conduit, causing the entire ship to short out

## how it gets turned back on

it's not as simple as resetting the fuse? Has the ship's power gone out before?

## plot emerges later

after they got the power back on:

"I remember, you gave me the note, and I wrote it down, with... the only writing implement I had on me at the time..."

"which would be.. oh sweet Oprah..."

"the rave pen..."

"so what we're looking for is written in invisible ink..."

"on a seemingly-blank piece of paper..."

"and the only way to find it is by turning out the lights..."

"and searching the fuck room with a blacklight. Wow. Not it"
