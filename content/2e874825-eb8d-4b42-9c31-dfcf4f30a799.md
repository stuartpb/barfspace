# Changes I'm thinking I'd like to make to some standing listings on the Unusual Studio Projects list

part of notes on [Unusual Studio](21528cfb-1ac3-4428-86df-86bb77154a23.md)

the [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words](fd9ccf36-f6e0-47bb-a456-6f14e669b304.md) should be redone as a Markdown repo, I think I settled on that a while ago

https://unusual.studio/projects/#29b020ea-0851-4ca0-9e1f-87119fd2c71c has been specced out within bagtent since we flew out to Orlando (though [mostly just as a TODO](bfdafa43-6389-46c1-a308-8e6cc68bf0a3.md) as of 2019-07-18)

Bagtent should be a thing in this list, [maybe eating some older ideas](454625ee-8b12-42b9-a05c-b2d533f08fcf.md)

Timetress could be another one that could be worked into a schema in Bagtent

Should probably note that I know how I want to implement the CSS dimmer thing

Should also have context for why I want to make the open Perspective Quantities data set? Maybe it should be community-based, where folks can vote "practical" (ie. "length of a football field"), "intriguing" (ie. when it's an interesting factoid, but not one you'd readily be familiar with), or "boring" (when it's neither)

## pieces that are worked into the June Judgment

SACRED should be interwoven with my notes more

Writing the Ship should be moved into Notes, same probably goes for Gullibot

In fact, the old "Help Wanted" repo should just be turned into a note - and the new "Help Wanted" repo can just be about navigating the current mish-mash-hodge-podge

## Big list of projects that have emerged in this list but aren't reflected there

In terms of things I figure I could work on in an Unusual Studio context:

- A lot of bagtent-related ideas, like frontends
- [Windowsystem Metabrowser](20768279-9c6d-4476-90d8-9dd15f3aa4d3.md)
- [Scrollbar Bookmarks](608f02cd-baa0-4426-ac27-469b585a2c4e.md)
- [Squorum (boxesin redux)](80c01468-5a12-4496-90f0-64abad259156.md)
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline](a4698628-2fba-4d14-9f31-72b8e9688445.md)
- [Casettic](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md)
- [an open karaoke platform](ac29634b-fa2e-49bb-864b-62704bcf365d.md)
- [This game thing with the Hashblots](70c6cf0c-360c-4f59-959a-663ed81b4751.md)
- the [floating pages idea](090b0260-e61d-490d-8031-fa89da8229da.md)
- [Therblig-based Bot Programmer](cc8a2a69-9df0-4e38-ac66-cb40a9f55531.md)
- [surpass / Gross Simplification](4abecfee-9100-45f3-9566-4d5234924dd2.md)
- [timewaiter](6f16c598-4c9c-4ba5-ad41-488662dcfcf4.md)
- [envigor](265f23de-445d-44d3-acfc-66e316cb03a2.md)
- [dym](b1bdad52-b669-4bf1-8708-6ef9d6dce47c.md)
- [dum](3c185b9f-9c22-492a-a6a4-5843e9addc13.md), a lean DOM-subset implementation

and that's just the first four project lists

Maybe this should be separated into Seed idea, In progress, and (for documented old projects like Surpass and Envigor) Viable?

## new projects since this page was created

no promises I'm gonna be able to list them all in here
