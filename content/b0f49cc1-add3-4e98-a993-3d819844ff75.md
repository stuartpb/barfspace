# Trello History of Lean Notes, Part II: Rambling Liveblogging

## Journal 5: The Midnight User Account Meteor Smash

started working on PlugMap for a bit, made an org, realized I had a bunch of user acount ideas that should go here. Dropped it in, made an Overview entry, wrote a bunch of Meta ranting on the Overview card because I'm shaking-tired, Overview is the closest thing to Meta for individual sections, and I had to work out how these ideas from PlugMap fit into glasstub.es. They do, but they're really different from everything I've Trello'd out so far.

Thinking I'd split Building App Servers, I made a Previous and Read On with two hypothetical titles. I went on to look at Building App Servers and realize it wasn't as wide-bloated as the lists to either side of it, which apparently I'd been thinking of.

Anyway, I realized explaining how to set up user implementation before explaining how to use databases is just perfectly glasstub.es' kind of crazy, so I made the split anyway. then I dropped a proposal in the Hosting and Infrastructure Overview list to split off the testing/staging/building automation stuff (originally what I meant by "infrastructure").

Then I went to bed because it was 10 AM and I hadn't slept all night.

## Journal 6: More sections from the top down

I added a few more sections. I think I fell asleep before I started writing this journal entry.

## Journal 7: Splits and Inserts

I spun Testing and Automation off from Hosting and Infrasture, as well as Going International (as the one-card-list for it didn't make sense there any more). I then realized Testing and Automation should really come first (even though they go back and forth), so I made a pretty weird shuffle-scramble. Some pointers got completely lost (Hosting and Infrastructure still pointed back to Building App Servers).

A few days later when I came back and wrote some more, I realized I can/could/should have a section about the computer/phone/device/browser thing. It could cover the from-the-ground-up aspect of explaining the web thing (since the first sentence in Enter The Web includes the word "computers" which, today, means something slightly different and broader than the popular conception), as well as stuff on choosing a device (which I'd sort of been covering loosely in a runaway train in the middle of the Introduction), and even a bit on how Servers work.

I also thought I might start adding cards for Quotes. To do that (I had two already on the Naming Things card in Getting Something Started and one in mind for the section that eases into an explanation of computers), I started making "Overture" sections. I also remade the big angry intro to Implementing User Accounts that I wrote when I was sleep-deprived as an Overture list.

The first list on Utilizing Databases fit well too. In general, this sort-of-meta-list takes a lot of burden off the rest of the board. (I'm not using board descriptions because I want overtures to be visible and Trello-able rather than hiding in the chrome.)

*A comment I made a few months later in January 2014:*

Appropriately enough, [Trello is phasing board descriptions out now](http://webapps.stackexchange.com/questions/54515/trello-board-is-missing-description-button), for exactly this reason (Fog Creek had been doing the same thing on their own boards).

## Journal 8: Domains, XML, primerprime, and Exploring

*(These cards were added around November 19, 2013)*

Putting a link to .mp in PlugMap's Trello from the OneTab for willithack, I realized I should probably put a note down in glasstub.es about Short Domains (since I've also explored this for Clipsnail etc). I also realized that CDN domains come up (also something that was relevant for Clipsnail), so I added a protip for that (splitting the "Internet & DNS" list off halfway to "Registering Domains", so there's an Education list and an Action list).

I then, once again, got sucked into writing glasstub.es, where I went to the end of the Enter the Web list and started poking around with the Conventions thing to explain how they weren't web standards (they're more just tools you often use?) Then I realized I should go into XML (and how it's Not A Good Thing), which after I wrote a bit I realized I wanted to go into the whole zeitgeist problem with the web and the W3C at the time, which would be a job for primerprime.

Somewhere around here I realized I should be drafting primerprime in Trello, and I should include my other major writing projects as Projects (previously I'd listed them exclusively in Writing). I even had the content of the card for Primer Prime be "note to self: make a Trello for this" - d'oh.

I'm wondering now if maybe the names for Primer Prime and glasstub.es should be switched. glassstub.es is more of a first-primer-for-everything, and primerprime is more of a history of moments like the "glass tubes" story.

## Journal 9: Exploring after Glasstubes

I started thinking about how this glasstub.es stuff is relevant, and where it stops- I read the card that describes how the best way to learn a thing is to explore it "(this is kind of a glasstub.es thing)", and I realized I should probably have something like an epilogue explaining how to go into that stuff (how to dive into the culture). I made two new sections (Email and SMS, Monetizing and Money Handling) and then made that.

I'm getting kind of tired of making these "Previous" and "Read on" links. I'm thinking i might rethink them, go back to basics a little (especially as the later sections get less linear).

Coming back to this a month later, I realized I needed a way to describe what I wanted to describe with "SMS": I didn't want to say "Phones" because that means smartphones. I changed it to "Phone Numbers".

## Journal 10: Preparedness, and the de-emphasis of linearity

*(this card created December 22, 2013)*

I came back to the glasstub.es trello to add a thing on re-adding Heroku remotes, and then I decided to start doing more with it again. I start writing up AWS's offerings, thought about Glacier and how I should cover backups, and realized I could also cover overall security in a new Security and Preparedness section.

I put off making it, though, because I didn't want to deal with these stupid Previous/Next cards again. Once I did make it, I decided I'd go back and start ripping the rotated rocket stickers off the old "infrastructural" versions of these cards and start treating their lists as *lists* again, and the cards themselves like the other cards of their ilk, explaining *all* the ways you could choose to continue and *why*. To keep the organization afforded by a rough "linear" order, I chose to keep the top cards as left and right pointers- but now, when lists are reorganized, they don't have to be shuffled around to other boards if they still fit- just moved down (and if they don't fit, they can be rewritten).

The biggest determinant of which list a card will be on is usually whether the relevant section comes before or after the current one, although it's allowed to be jumbled a little for instances where the lines are blurred (like Hosting and Staging, or Databases and User Accounts).
