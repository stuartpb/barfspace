# The Pre-history of Lean Notes

## Journal i: the initial idea

I made glasstub.es some time several months back, when I was starting yet another website project, because I realized a few things:

1. I have a more or less standard procedure I follow for making these projects, based on things I know.
2. Most people don't realize they can make sites the way I make them. They don't know what's involved, so they assume it requires some great sum of manpower, money, space, and basically everything involved in starting a company.
3. I only know how to do this stuff because I pieced it together from several slapdash articles across the web, tutorial, documentation, encyclopedia, and otherwise, on top of some just trying-and-doing.
4. Every piece of information I'd gleaned was predicated on having already read and understood several other pieces of information, and knowing that you'd need to seek out the specific things I'd read without anybody really telling how these pieces fit together (and a lot of the time, they didn't - there'd be huge gaps that neither side would describe, and the only place you'd fill it would be, like, one sentence in the middle of a huge, dry, boring series of pages).
5. If there was one site out there that explained all the stuff I can do, other people would realize how not-hard it is, other people would do it, and there'd be more of a market for the kind of thing I do without needing a startup.

I knew I could help other people realize their big ideas. I thought of the Cliff Gardner speech from SportsNight, checked if glasstub.es was already taken, and reserved it.

## Journal 0: Pre-Trello activity

After I reserved the glasstub.es domain, I created a GitHub repo, cloned a workspace on Cloud9, and started writing.

But I didn't really know how I wanted to present it, or how I'd address the problems I have with what's already out there. I didn't just want to throw another tutorial / book on the pile: I wanted to introduce all-new innovations that would steamroll over the limitations in format I suspected were behind my distaste for what was already out there. (If it just involved plain-old *writing*, I reasoned, surely somebody would have already written it!)

I tried making a number of directories of Markdown files and copying in shell commands and tricks that I found useful, but I couldn't conjure the energies to start writing the actual content I had meant to impart.

Time passed, and I worked on other projects and looked for work. A few times, I found myself wanting to show prospective employers my skill through glasstub.es, but I couldn't, as I still hadn't written it.

One day, I started listing my projects on a board on Trello. That grew out to me using a board for some of my projects, which grew out to me using organizations of boards. I also started drafting another project I've been working on by writing the notes for each chapter in lists on a Trello board.

Then, the next time I came across a prospect I would have liked to show glasstub.es to, I realized I could apply the same approach. What follows is detailed in the subsequent journals.
