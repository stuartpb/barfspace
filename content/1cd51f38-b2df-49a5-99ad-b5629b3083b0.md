# Lean Notes and Linkdumps

This quest is an artifact that was originally written under [Data Smuggling][], with a lot of other unrelated and obsolete stuff. It was been trimmed and somewhat rewritten to make sense as part of [Barfspace Vision Quests][BVQ], where it languished in obscurity until being cut out to this dedicated artifacts page because *it belongs in a museum!*

Apparently this was the origin of the thought process that led into [Project Akira][]? Looking at the list, it looks like this might have been the one that clinched it.

This should get propagated out to:

- wherever it is that I'm going to list "how I do stuff", or "how thoughts become notes"
- the Linkdump nexus
- the Lean Notes index

things that are brought up in the artifact stuff below that still aren't well-integrated into the notes elsewhere:

- there should be a guideline on how non-checkbox entries in Quests lists should be considered
- that "here are links I'm saving for posterity in this pursuit" should be a distinct "thing" that I do as much as Quests
  - I feel like this bit has kind of evolved into [Journeys][] - ie. the "various directions I go in" is what led to the "IPFS" Journey page
  - Reconciling it with the Lean Notes structure is still pending, though...
    - As is having a really sufficient notespace for reflecting on this kind of cross-discovery-to-publication integration.
    - The advantages of having this kind of documented procedure, even if the procecss isn't 100% firmed up yet, is documented at the Strike Force Base Camp forming to tackle some of this artifact business at the mouth of [how-i-roll's Tomb][].

- [ ] It'd be nice to have some kind of linkdump for the various directions I go in discovering resources for Data Smuggling
  - [ ] This kind of linkdump also sounds like something that'd be movable to Lean Notes, except that I guess I feel the subject matter is a bit too esoteric.
  - [ ] Maybe this is a weird way to frame this, but: have I considered absorbing Lean Notes into this repository, and that way I just have one big mass of notes instead of an arbitrary divide between both? I like that
  - To be clear, I'm bringing this up right here because it's a blocker in the sense that creating linkdumps aggregating my notes on discovering things in various domains is not only pretty clearly Lean Notes' turn right now, but I'm pretty sure I've even already made a few Lean Notes (Also, hey, first time I've put a non-checkbox for a bulleted item on one of these lists, for when I'm just straight-up making notes inline with my todo, and there's no way it could possibly be acted upon! *hobgoblin of consistency slain*
    - [x] Rejoin this thread back up somewhere around the "Quest About Describing These Quests" spec / style guide quest.
  - [ ] Complete the quest about steeling your nerve and changing the repo name to "notes.stuartpb.com"
  - [ ] This would also justify allowing multiple-first-ancestor merges into the tree, since this is a major content merger, and it would make merging in other smaller foreign trees like Pitches and Scripts less of a big deal.
