# Functions for a B Key

I was just looking for a good excuse to find functionality for the "b" key on [this](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61vprTbdlwL._AC_SX679_.jpg) (where it was "black screen"), for other apps you might code up with it

## video players

have "b" be the "boss key", which takes you to some business-looking screen (Email?) that has all this cast info, so it's double-functional

## appliance prototypes

these are already mapping the keys specially
