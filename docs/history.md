my original plan with this was to just have a workspace where I'd keep a bunch of files and never commit them to Git or push them to GitHub

I ended up adding the thing that autocommits and pushes because a) I actually do like version history, and b) I like having my content pushed to GitHub

what I had a problem with was trying to make things fit in
