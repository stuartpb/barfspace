# Selling Bagtent

"Selling" in the sense of [Selling to Help](nvbey-qw331-rd9rg-yrd9e-2djwb)

You've got this whole crazy system for structuring content, and you're using it like crazy, but you still haven't explained the *why* of this system to anybody, the *what* or the *how*.

- [ ] Don't forget about [How I'm Writing With Bagtent](2f7b6-zmstm-cvbwf-7cfrd-wadwc)
- [ ] Link or merge this into [BISNES][]
- [ ] Write up an explainer on bagtent (ie. finish README)
- [ ] Identify strengths and weakness (ie. When It Might Make Sense to Use Bagtent)
- [ ] See if anybody would be interested in being a producer for bagtent (a la the [quest for "Requests for Producers"](95b1z-3ejtm-pqar2-pj4t1-t3w83))
- [ ] Think about a logo or artwork for bagtent.
  - [ ] Look through your Tabalanche stash to see if you can find that picture of a failed 3d print where some of the pieces were partway printed, it was cool, and a good mood-board inspirational aesthetic for all this.
