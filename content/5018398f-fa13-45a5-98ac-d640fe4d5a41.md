# fun observations/adventutes on gitpod and theia

I accidentally a bunch of orphan files into this repo, and I'm not sure how much of it is based on `gp open` choking on opening non-existent filenames? is that a bug that should be reported? maybe `--touch` needs to be an option to conjure so it can touch-then-open (and touch+print will remain the default behavior)

I also just see `gp open` fail with no explanation?

update: I reported this bug. it's not so much that it's choking on nonexistent files, as that it's not readily exiting after opening the editor, causing me to avoid rigging up the file as I don't have the UUID on my console to copy. the fact that empty files are created is an expected side effect of opening the editor to a new file and having auto-saving on (which I have because, A, it's barfspace, and B, gitpod doesn't seem to persist buffers)

should also look into the thing where clicks on the "preview/view source" button also fall through to the tab below which is gross (UPDATE: I believe I reported this issue and it was promptly fixed with a batallion of special cases that did not make Theia's architecture look appetizing)
