# My Old Bad Ideas

This musing is kind of intrinsically tied to [how I try to sort my shit out][get your shit together].

It was, for a time, host to the [Project Akira planning content][Akira], the predecessor to the new "get your shit together" page: I've come to a bit more clarity on this concept, and as such, I'm reworking all this.

## The Mistake I Used to Make

I used to think that having a *perfectly-shaped vessel* was the main impediment I had to a bunch of stuff: that, once I could come up with the *perfect table of contents*, the perfect title, the perfect structure-for-this-content, I'd be able to knock it all out in a way I never could before.

I was convinced that the thing inhibiting my creativity was the lack of a venue for it. To some extent that was true: my output *exploded* once I found Cloud9, and I no longer had to wrestle with "I can't work on that right now, I don't have my workspace for it handy". Or just the fear of losing my uncommitted work, of having my tooling become lost and obsolete.

But, like, the actual solution ended up being to find *the barest bit* of structure I needed, and then to work from there. For example, I think I had this remark on a Trello card I had, for an idea I'd had of how some Stack Overflow questions would better be answered by a full page that could receive community contributions in the form of pull requests, one that could be forked if the original maintainer stopped paying attention or doing maintenance:

> This seemed like a smart idea when I wrote it, but looking back, it's redundant to... Stack Overflow questions and Octopress posts. This idea failed one of the criteria I've only really come to understand in the last few years: "is there anything stopping the kind of user who'd know what to do with this from doing it themselves today?"

After I copied that quote into this page, I found myself remarking on something that I was finding myself smack-dab in the middle of:

> (Update: in light of what I'm doing right now with Lean Notes where I'm effectively turning it into a federated wiki of guides, that last one is especially hilarious)

"what I'm doing with Lean Notes" would eventually be abstracted out as [bagtent][], which ends up being perfectly amenable to what I was describing - except *simpler*, because, unlike Octopress posts, the name of a particular approach or solution can be *preserved across forks*, however the site forking it chooses to present the URL.

This has been one of the great Enlightenments I have received over the past few years: how many complicated ideas can be boiled down to just "a collection of interlinked documents". It's easy to lose sight of the fact that the World Wide Web is, itself, an app - the whole Internet is just an "application" of computing, and "computing" as we know it is just a particular application of logic and electrical engineering (and a bunch of less-Aneristic forces, due to the taint of being forced to interface with humans).

Beyond that, though - because this is a bigger idea than just that, like how I legitimately needed a Web IDE to be productive - there's some idea lurking about the nature of MVPs.

## Excision from Bagtent Brainstorm Ideas

Here's how this thought came out in [Barfspace Vision Quests][BVQ]:

[BVQ]: n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j

all you really need is a few common constraints and you don't need to layer another layer on it if the internet has publishing simple enough

- Also, I mentioned the Catch-All Rap Session: one thing I wanted to float there is how catch-alls need a way to exist when the buffer runs out, if they have an outbound flow, which they should if your organic flow is good and scalable
- Another thought in this vein, and I mentioned the cutting point between different pages/files in another sidebar musing, but juggling carets and their effect on cognitive load and creating incomplete traces is another great factorization slice for having multiple buffers / files (thouhg, yeah, man, I'd love a keystroke for "remember this text position and let me come back to it"... ah hell, this is a thing Vim has isn't it, I've become one of those people that's building a format so bad I need my editor to be more powerful to compensate

## A thought on tooling

(which kind of comes from the stream of consciousness the above excerpt trailed off to?)

Dedicated UIs are like The Shoveler's shovel.

"You must lash out with every limb, like the octopus who plays the drums!"

This is kind of a thing about MVPs, and the importance of building around minimal tooling - it allows for problems to be solved with tools *the user may be more comfortable with naturally as a product of their circumstances*

Like, with Cloud9 to revise barfspace, I can right-click and "Copy file location" to get a URL for a thing, which isn't a *great* UX, but in a pinch? *It's often the fastest way I can think to get a page's URL.* If I were making a whole UI for this, I'd have to think about the implications of an affordance for that, and all the nightmares that go along with it.

This train/realm of thought should really have its own page
