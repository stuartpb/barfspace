# Scroll Bookmarks

Scroll position is a cool thing to save - this also touches Tabalanche, and a thing where I'd like to be aple to "put my finger and the book, scroll back up, and resume my position"

On Windows, I'd sort of fake this by dragging the toolbar, then dragging away to return to the original position, but nothing on Linux supports this
