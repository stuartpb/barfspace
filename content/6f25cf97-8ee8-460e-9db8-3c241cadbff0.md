# Quests

This page hosted the first real explosion of content in these notes.

[the Quests Style Guide page](13ff3791-e256-443b-9b76-6ce1a594c7a8.md) is still around to reflect the guiding principles of this Quest design.

Its function has been made largely redundant by pages off the [Projects](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) page, as well as the meta structures for these notes

Its real legacy, though, was in the "list as thought tree" style which has made a resurgence as of mid-2019.
