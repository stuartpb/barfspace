# Bagtent Browser Note Hub

This page aggregates everything around a good UI for browsing / editing [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md).

The notes on that page are important, and might even make sense for some of those to be integrated into the view from this vantage.

Actually, going through now... I think what's really needed right now is an index collecting this whole aspect of Bagtent.

## Meta thought

This should be dragged to the Oozy Sewer, but these subpages are being merged in when they were only ever one heading/section long, and cherry-picked from when they're longer

## Note

I'm realizing this page was separate from that page because I *meant to have CLI tooling notes*.

Most of this content should be kicked back to there (being rich-UI-oriented), and then this can link there, and link to another page focusing on CLI tools - and aggregate concepts that are legitimately shared between them. (And some things are shared between just the Rich UI stuff and outside concerns, like Git / the notestack!)

## Navigation notes

This is the stuff that used to be on [this page](bf03649f-7721-4d95-af2e-bfe803bf996a.md) (or should have been?)

- [Tabbing Concept from a OneNote State of Mind](5cd79fae-dd34-4959-99e0-931d32933a76.md)
- [thoughts on a renderer](4eba78a6-3d95-4a71-aa05-a3088af7e870.md)
  - I believe there's some stuff on breadcrumb navigation to be pulled out here
- [Horus, the Tree Navigation UI for Bagtent](87790b88-2585-4460-921e-a0dec3846b04.md)
- [Borkflowy, the Bagtent Accordion concept](a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md)
- [This Bagtent Publisher concept](852e122b-e5af-474a-99c9-31a1d01d0870.md)

## Editing tool considerations

- [bagtent editor ideas](e1c84681-d395-4533-81c1-233f5bb5bbe3.md)

## Command-line tools

I'm actually not sure where to put notes on the Bagtent CLI tools? anyway, for now I'm putting them here:

- [Profiling and parallelizing Node scripts](39a6a7d4-c75e-475d-af2f-282fb7205a99.md)
