# Meditations and Musings

This index is where I'm saying things where I have something to say about them, apropos of (more or less) nothing. Synthesizing full-length articles is hard, and most of the time I feel like it'd just be diluting the impact of the kernel of the matter.

This was originally supposed to be a set of guidelines surrounding the drafting of technical specifications, but as it sprawls in scope, it can also be interpreted as a set of guidelines around any sort of design, and, in a broader interpretation, as [an abstract philosophy of life][ZAMM] (with shout-outs to the driving philosophies of others).

All opinions expressed are my own, except the Robustness Principle was Jon Postel's.

Also cribbing from [The Design of Everyday Things][] and [The Pragmatic Programmer][].

## A quick note on the name

I'm actually thinking this page might be switched back to being called Musings, like the version that was left in barfspace was called when barfspace expanded to incorporate more than just remnants from the old meditations repo. IT's not like my musings are all that deep, and I feel like I'd rather have the word "meditations" reserved for, you know... actual meditation.

## The Format

Each md file should be about the size of a GitHub issue comment, one that'd be appropriate posted in many issues, and at the same time appropriate in none. They should stand alone, [like a dandelion seed forever drifting on the wind, by which we may know the universe][seed].

## More Meditations

These were the meditations that were split off into "Musings" in barfspace - if memory serves, they're the files that "weren't done yet". More details on [the former Musings page][Musings].

## Meta-musings

Hare are some more meditations that pertain especially to how I roll here in barfspace:

- [My Old Bad Ideas][]
- [Humans Don't Need (Much) Structure][My New Good Ideas]
- [Relying On and Reproducing Context][weird]
- [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity][metavertigo], about the terrifying cognitive loop of trying to get too meta

A few more very rough reflections on the nature of [barfspace][OBRN] that used to live on the [meta page][BSMC]:

- [The Sincerity of Sloppiness][being-messy.md]
- [Hemingway Style][]
- [Musings on Barfspace's Shotclock][shipping.md]

These are kind of rough, but I haven't really figured out what would make sense to make them fit on this page better: they might find new life under the "[News][]" branch of endeavor at some point, where I just sort of free-associatively write a thing on what's on my mind.

## Also kind of musing-like

I'm not sure if this page should be the primary "category" for these, but:

### this is the closest page to a primary I could think of

- [Best Practices for Login Tokens][surpass-but-for-nilpass]

### it definitely works as, like, an affiliate musing

And, like, these were all arbitrary links I sorted pages into when I was first destructuring the repo, and I went many-to-one because I wanted it to be straightforward, but now the bagtemt glow cloud is really a-rollin' and it's no big deal if everything just sticks to everything

- [My Perfect Workspace World][]

### These were originally going to be big projects

Here are some rough pages I'd originally planned to write entire books (or at least booklets) for, most of which had been linked in my list of [Collected Writings][], often with more text being dedicated to describing *what the planned repository was intended to collect* than *actual text within the repository* (for many of these, those descriptions form the bulk of their content here):

- [stuartpb On Security][]
- [Nerd First][]
- [Selling to Help][]
- [Undesign][]
- [Primer Prime][]
- [Everybody Gets a Factory][]
- [Namespace Taboos][]

These were originally merged into the [Lean Notes][] repository, but they're only really useful in that ontology if they're filled with content, and I don't remember these being filled with content. If they start to get some content in them, maybe we'll start moving them into the Lean Notes tree then.

There were a few other things like this (that wouldn't make as much sense as Lean Notes, hence why they were merged into barfspace instead) at the page called [Big Works in Progress][BWiP], but we're just going to have to figure something else out, because that page kind of sucks.

Basically, I think the original intention of "Collected Writings" (to highlight cool things I've written or am writing that people could check out) is now best served by the [Visitor's Center Tour][], and the other half (to show off cool things I *want* to write) is better served by... opening up a note and just writing the gist of it.

Coming up with a cool name and packaging and then being too tuckered out to put anything *into it* was one of the hallmarks of [My Old Bad Ideas][MOBI].
