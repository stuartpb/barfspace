So this is an old idea I had back in 2013 (judging by when the card was created on my Projects board - I'd likely had some variation of the idea before that).

The idea, as I originally thought of it, was to have a website with one giant "time stream of everything", and you could add events to it with any time and date and accompanying data.

(I used to have a lot of these kinds of ideas: "Let's make a site that contains a certain kind of data, then everybody who wants to make that kind of data will magically appear and start using it!")
