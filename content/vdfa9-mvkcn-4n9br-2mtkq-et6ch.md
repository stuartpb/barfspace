# Thoughts on the Barfspace Arcs

Most of the "quests" that were drafted before this split were very inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

In fact, this kind of not-having-a-page-for-individual-quests thing kind of dates back to back when conjuring pages was more awkward. Now, we're moving each of these quests to their own page, and as the pages get lighter (with the cruftier and more-confused pieces getting shunted out of sight), modern roles for these pages are emerging.
