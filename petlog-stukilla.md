uuuuuuugh

installed cgpt on sd card which is whatever alias

changed sdcard hostname so I'd know when I'm experimenting on that and not the other one

installed libgl-mesa because the other 4 are for some kind of special chip that's irrelevant

installed the libinput whatever instead of the evdev one

installed the regular libx264 because 10bit is mostly an encoding advantage and doesn't have hardware support

went with noto fonts for ttf-font satisfaction because hey why not that's chromey (obvs I'd rather do them all but it only prompted for one)

install git, metasploit, chromium, awesome, notion, budgie-desktop, lightdm
