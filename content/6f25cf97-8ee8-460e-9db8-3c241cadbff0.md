# My Life in Quests

This is a kind of legacy page, tracking the following pages, which all have their roots in a great giant page I made for Quests back in the early days of this repo (might have even been before Project Akira, I'd have to go back and check).

These days, I'm changing a lot of these pages into subject hubs that aren't quest-oriented.

For documentation of the old Quest content, see [the Quests Style Guide page](13ff3791-e256-443b-9b76-6ce1a594c7a8.md).

## Pages that have been reworked

These pages have gravitated into more modern configurations:

- [Maker Quests][]
  - [3D Printer Upgrades][] (hasn;t *quite* been reworked, but it's definitely under Maker Quests)
- The three major branches from the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] were originally quests:
  - [Operations][BQO]
  - [Visions][BQV]
  - [Implementations][BQI]
- [Desktop Quests](445ae6d8-5796-43b7-8648-704c8ebb9e18.md)
- [Fixer Arc][]
- Reshaping Security (which might work as the stuartpb on Security node):
  - [NilPass Quests](7e171d29-590d-4636-9c2e-80cdaef10e92.md)
- Windowsystem muckery:
  - [Metabrowser Windowsystem](20768279-9c6d-4476-90d8-9dd15f3aa4d3.md)
  - [Tabalanche Quests](f943c3f6-afa6-4f9a-9ce1-89b72ef2e581.md)

## Still kinda relevant maybe

These pages may not have been reworked, but, like, I remember that they exist, they have traces in other parts of the notes

- [Road to the Wedding][Wedding]
- [Mindfulness Arc][] (Isn't this kind of like a "fitness" thing? gahh)
- [Toolchained Melody][tools]
  - [Plushu Quests][]


## Largely unvisited since Quests was made

These are unloved and, if you asked me what's in 'em, I probably couldn't tell you.
