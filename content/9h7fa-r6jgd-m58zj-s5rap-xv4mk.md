# Out-of-Band Manager

or as I'd awkwardly titled it before looking it up, "Serial over LAN (Better than SSH) Worst-Case-Scenario Terminal/Control Device"

What I'd like is a thing I could plug into a device and it'd start a *terminal serial console level* connection to the computer available via SSH/Wi-Fi hotspot - better than making it provision a display device, just a hardware thing that we can start ptty terminals with.

I feel like I was looking for this at one point, as a thing for Abe / Quadration / building my own hardware cluster? I feel like I remember "IP-KVM" as a term

Anyway here are some notes on [doing this on a Pi or something you could order on Amazon](prxbq-st1d6-g98t1-vt8b8-7h40a)
