This hit, when you know, Aunt Irma, that red flow<br>
This one's for them bud girls, them blood girls, straight menstruators<br>
Slidin', while in, living it up in the kitty<br>
Gotta shove on, and sing this song, go about our day sittin' pretty

Too hot (HOT CLAM!), gonna sponge off endometriam<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), pull me out when I retire, ma'am<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), say my name, you know what I am,<br>
Too hot (HOT CLAM!), and I'm bout being absorbent / breaking down
