# Thoughts on a new iteration of the necklace's beads

I'm thinking I might try them a couple millimeters wider, like 18mm - targeting enough space to bend without showing too much cable between

I think I might like them to snap together a little more because of how they're *designed* than how they're *oriented* (see how the reoriented print failed to snap together at all).

## Update

I was originally thinking of something where there'd be a cylindrical "bite" into the pearl on the other end, from each pearl (this was described as a "mutual clasp" in the Git history, IIRC): this ended up being more visually disruptive to the internal lighting, the pieces were smaller and more prone to breaking (I've had better luck taking the current design apart)

I made a *really nice* design that used a sphere-intersection over the LED on the other side of the strip (the "tennis clasp"), but ultimately it didn't look better, so I backed it out.

## Smoothing

Anyway, one advantage of making these something that can be easily dismantled is that you can maybe snap them together, throw them in a rock tumbler (maybe in PETG if rock tumblers are too hot)

TODO: throw in links to rock tumblers, the DIY one on Thingiverse, etc

## Experiments I tried and gave up on

- Printing vertically. Surprisingly, this made it *harder* to snap the halves together.
- Hilbert or Octagram Spiral fills. The Hilbert one was just too refractive, and I could tell I'd have the same issues on Octagram

## Experiments that outright failed

- Merging every 3 layers of infill - this turned into a little plastic snake.
