# Build Logs and Maker Ideas

These are some projects I'm working on with components that can't just be downloaded to any old Linux system, like 3D printed stuff.

## Near here

- [Craft Lounge](mfhgt-e8994-g68fv-5abmd-qepr5)

### Minor household crafts

Some of these things I haven't really written on:

- Wheeled tote thing
- "Underwear required beyond this point" sign
- Desk clips for light strips

### Basically just a slight remix

(this could maybe be moved with the next section to another page, like "Remixes and Derivative Works" - doesn't have to be mutually exclusive with this page, or other categorizations of project, ie. if it's a printer upgrade - or even a household craft)

- [picture frame](kew3z-htsbf-02agy-8yc11-7scrd)
  - there's also a different kind of "derivative" project in there

## existing things to rework / remix
