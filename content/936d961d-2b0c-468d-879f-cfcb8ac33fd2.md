# Lean Notes Principles and Style

[tiling background image](https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/images/backgrounds/wave.png)

I've taken the lists from this Meta board and made separate pages for each of them:

- [Tenets](279c6861-3793-4769-9770-20dde42baf70.md)
- [What Lean Notes is not](f6040ec1-7d9a-4373-8f58-8929bfef41bb.md)
- [Anti-techniques](668e33e2-318a-47bc-82d0-2509d24b8351.md)
- [Style](5dfe8cc7-8cf1-44f6-af04-3f864afb80ac.md)

## Also

[this page on Emergent Patterns in Lean Notes](26186b36-081d-46b0-a36c-c49e82214766.md) was originally from another board, but it makes more sense here going forward.

The first list on the board was just "Taglines", listing "Notes on a Startup Project" and "Zero to Software" as various brainstorming alternate titles.

I've ended up going with the latter to rescope Lean Notes' old content, even though I fucked up and didn't buy the domain when I had the idea (causing someone else to use it a few years later)
