# The Shotclock and CI

Remember back when Barfspace auto-committed, and how you've stopped running it in the migration to bagtent because you don't want the repository committing with unreachable posts? Let's fix that.
.
- [x] Write the bagtent-orphans script.
  - You used the bagtent-orphans script to make sure you weren't forgetting any files you'd created before making a commit. Nice job!
- [ ] Make a new version of the shot clock that has a key you can press to conjure a new file, which will have its name printed on the command line, and be added to the commit and all
- [ ] In conjunction with the feature above, have the shot clock pause when it finds a file is orphaned, and only rechecks, like, every seven seconds?
  - [ ] or only manually seems fine to me - probably easier to code, too
    - [ ] "Add a feature to the shotclock script that lets it hold off on running the shotclock when a test command fails." (misplaced quest item from elsewhere)
  - [ ] Should still have a way to invoke conjure while there are orphans, if you need it
  - [ ] Reminder that the conjure button should both echo the name AND pop open an editor tab, following a given command / alias you're expected to have in place and defaulting to `c9 open` or something like that? Is there already a version of `$EDITOR` that means "nonblocking invocation to open a new buffer"?
- [ ] What about the command to open a file by toplink name? Or just a "run a grep on all content files" key.
- [ ] Have a way, if there isn't one, to limit the shot clock's watch scope to just content files.
- [ ] Write a new git-slum-like script that just describes changes in terms of total bytes across files.
- [ ] Hell, just a Markdown editor with a preview pane that lets you open other files by link would be hugely helpful (EDITOR'S NOTE: wrong list)
- [ ] Figure out how to make commit messages that are just like "597+685=1282 changed bytes" (removals + additions)
  - Better: default shotclock message is how long between the first and last change, ie. "5 minutes of work"
  - "24 Seconds of Work: The Barfspace Story"
