# more Smort brainstorming: LAB

this page can be for stray thoughts on SMORTLAB as a level

You can have something like Hollow Knight's Spirit for heal-tanking here? Like you can choose to trade off Enemy Energy for Health

(Dumb Acronym Opportunity Alert: Big Enemy Energy Sources, or BEES - "five Bees to a nickel")

Maybe also you can stockpile replenishing containers you don't need here - maybe that's a tool, like the Container Carrier, which is a little serving tray you carry the item on

## A little aside

A huge part of this fascination with having an easily-accessible hub, from the first screen to the bowels of the beast, actually comes from the freaking Pagemaster adventure game from the 90s, where there's a point in Horror where they decided to just reuse the background for Richard's room, and when he goes "it's... my room?" Horror goes "Oh no, this is MY room! I just made it to look exactly like yours!" and that thought, of having a perfect replica of your cozy little suburban home in the middle of this freaking gothic nightmare... that stuck with me

## color cores idea

It should be possible to make your Hands Model change colors somehow?

idk, maybe they're particle effects you can attach to a core to signify it's active?

do we want to overlap this with the device itself
