# Drybox Gauge Idea

You could have a lever on the side of the drybox that measures from the top edge (of the maximum rolling circle per axle position) to the (rolling) center of the drybox on a linear scale, if that's possible? Interchangeable gearboxes for various measurement types?

So, like, you'd have the gauge pre-defined for a spool that has a spool outer diameter (ie. the diameter for the innermost coil of filament) and width (where we might be able to gauge a length of filament remaining based on optimal filament wrapping, or it could just be estimated based on the reduction from 100%)

but yeah, I think, really, it just comes down to where you put the crossbar for the lever to get this scale

## non-gearbox thought

you'd want a slide that covers its opening as much as possible
