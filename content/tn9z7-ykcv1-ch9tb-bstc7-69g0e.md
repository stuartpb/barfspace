(I have never seen an Air Bud movie)

We open on a hallway of framed news articles:

- "BASKETBALL DOG EARNS FOOTBALL'S HIGHEST HONOR"
- "AMERICAN FOOTBALL DOG EARNS ACTUAL FOOTBALL'S HIGHEST HONOR" (Der Spiegel)
- "GOLDEN RETREIVER SWEEPS WORLD SERIES"
  - Sub headline: "THIRD WEIRDEST THING TO HAVE EVER HAPPENED IN BASEBALL"
- "SPORTS DOG COMES OUT ON TOP IN BEACH VOLLEYBALL CHMAPIONSHIPS"
  - sub headline: "Is there anything this dog can't do??"
- "AIR BUDDY ANNOUNCES CANDIDACY FOR U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES"
- "MR. BUD GOES TO CONGRESS", "BUDDY BEATS TRUMMAN"
  - various papers announcing Buddy having won the election two years ago
