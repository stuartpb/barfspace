# Browser Extensions and the Extension API

Granted, I've worked with Chrome Extensions before, which is what this API is based on, but [I'm only just now switching to another browser][Firefox], so it's time to start looking into how the rest of the world does it.

[Firefox]: 7b0f829a-7fbe-4896-9b5d-8196e1bca2a4.md

https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/ being Firefox's hub for all this

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons being their documentation jumping-off point

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions summarizing the design

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Porting_a_Google_Chrome_extension has some notes - the only real change is going to be refactoring to use Promises, which all my newer extensions are designed to do anyway

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Chrome_incompatibilities continues: I just wanna say, I was *not* expecting the incompatibility list to be *this minor*

https://github.com/mozilla/webextension-polyfill will be the drop-in to accomodate that (all my extension development will be Firefox First like this going forward)

## note on incompatibility

https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1319168 - this probably affects Rogueport and/or Pull Tool / Rejig

## this isn't really notes but

Extensions to port:

- Tabalanche
- NilPass
- The one that takes specimen snapshots of pages and posts them to Gist
- KeyboardLeopard I guess
- Hey wouldn't it be cool if I brought back Clipsnail?
