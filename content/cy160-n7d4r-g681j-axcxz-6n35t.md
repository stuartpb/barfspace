# manifest of state of my first-round Notes workspace

This setup died with the rest of [Studtop Mark I](kbryw-6dc19-r18n7-6pg5d-4aqwf) in the process of enacting the [June 5 2020 Sprint](0ybvg-vc5qr-wv8pq-y58xr-2da4r)

 is being remade as [Notespace on Stubernetes Mark II](ew948-5shty-wb8bc-hn5t6-7k18j)

## Notable logs from studtop mk 1 on this workspace in particular

- Arc of Creation
  - [One Last Step](agjgk-05zhg-y7a0a-6r713-7qesk)
- [Day 2](2ncae-q5n8d-9da26-enghc-n8ydb)
- ran into a problem where the files in the PVC stopped working.
  - this was probably foreshadowing the problems that necessitated the June 5 procedure
  - wanting to know how we got here is why I want to install Loki as soon as Prometheus in Mk 2
