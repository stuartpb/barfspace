# more Getting One's Shit Together, 2019-05-01

Expanding "Mindfulness Quests" out to [a larger Wellness nexus][Wellness], which I'm thinking kind of covers a lot of what I was thinking for Right Now? And, honestly, can't this page kind of take the rest? Just a constantly updating log of "here's what I was up to in the notes"?

just wrote a long old thing on what is currently termed [Musings][] about how the pages linked there should probably get factored off to further subpages for more juggling

and now I'm getting a bit of deja vu like I might have covered this notion before somewhere else, like the Operations quests? should probably check that

I've been making a point to keep my link references in the first gap after the block I write them, as proposed in the call for best practices under the [Barfspace Vision Quests][BVQ] - I've decided it's better to just keep redundant symbols if you're going to link to the same page multiple times in a file (the renderer should be able to handle it okay, though I might want to look into what the spec behavior is supposed to be for this re: what happens if the targets don't match between multiple instances of the same tag).

continuing 2019-05-07: having the links closer to their reference also makes it simpler to recognize when a link is no longer referenced, so you don't just have a bunch of garbage link pointers lying around at the bottom of your file.
