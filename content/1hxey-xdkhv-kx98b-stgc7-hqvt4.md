# more thoughts and a summary of the user model on my pocketchip

see [devising the user outlay](kwy8k-vpnsm-c8a8y-550mm-htkwy)

TODO: recap what I plotted out there here, in a normal way

## thoughts about plastic additions to the security model

the password for the chip user (not my password) could be stored... encrypted under my user somehow? stored on my desktop? and 3D printed on the stylus

it could be encrypted, in a file under my user that is read-only-to-me, with a password inside the opaque casing

(also, no need to get cute, you could just write it with a sharpie)

but the cool thing about the "guest and autologin chip" model is that the stylus can be the literal "hardware key" to delegate trust in this environment
