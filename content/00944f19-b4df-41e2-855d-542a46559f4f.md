# It's The Ecology, Stupid

This is a little place where I'm holding my mindstorms on the environment, climate change, biospheres, the ability of the Earth's atmosphere to support terrestrial life, you know, all that hippie crap

[This Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/BuildSoil/status/1138125178842492928) is pointing me at some great stuff - [this bit about producing an egg in particular](https://twitter.com/BuildSoil/status/1138132884902912001) is something I'm gonna start adapting to [the messays on design](458f8a16-f237-4f8e-8e17-474408732536.md)

Be Earth Compatible (ie. use natural processes over against-the-grain ones)

## The Need for Climate Optimism

I've had this really crucial thing knocking around in my head for a while about how we need climate optimism to spurn us to action: we've got a kind of fatalism around the rise of ecofascism right now - it feels like the human species is in hospice - and I feel like we need to articulate a vision of "wild shit is being discovered every day, and previous generations have all had their own scientifically-impending demises averted by black swan events" to communicate the way that, while the magnitude of the changes that will need to be made grows ever larger, *that doesn't mean it is slipping from our grasp*.

The RALPH article [From Versailles to Cybernetics](http://www.ralphmag.org/batesonP.html) kind of touches on this, in that it opens talking about how history holds cycles of depression and defeatism.
