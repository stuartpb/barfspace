# My eBay review of the Pocket C.H.I.P.

## May it live a thousand years

With a few 3D-printed enhancements (such as a stylus, and a keyboard faceplate with buttons), this has become my go-to handheld for technical tinkering. The device is full of small quality-of-life innovations that I've never seen before, and haven't seen since (such as a finger-friendly divot in the center of the back, and holes in the bottom to stand the device upright using a pencil or pen). It's a shame that the manufacturer went out of business (I got mine from RE-PC in Tukwila, WA), but the last updates they put out (and all the source files to produce its parts) have been mirrored online, and the device's killer apps (SunVox, PICO-8, and a few minimal X11 utilities) work just fine without needing further updates.
