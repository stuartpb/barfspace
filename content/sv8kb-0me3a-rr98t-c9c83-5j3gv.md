# Lean Notes Tags

This is a page for the "tags" of Lean Notes:

- I Made a Thing
- Useful Tool
- Good Read
- Spotlight
- Chapter Link
- Knowledge
- Protip
  - Protips are for generalized insights meant to inform the actions you take and the plans you make.
- Anecdote
- Instructions
- Costs Money

These tags are maintained in [a separate repo][LN-tags], where they will be pulled from if/when Lean Notes is ever published in a more polished form outside of this repo. See the notes on [this page][mixed content] for more about this.

## Historical note

These evolved out of labels used on cards when this was drafted on Trello:

- External links (Useful Tool, Good Read, Spotlight) were all a green "External Link" label
- Internal links (Chapter Link) were yellow labels
- Education (Knowledge) was the navy blue label
- Protip was the purple label (and came in after the Red and Blue labels, originally meant to be interweaved without protips)
- Instructions was the red label
- Paid Services (Costs Money) was a seafoam-color label that I'm not sure was ever used
- Anecdotes were a sky-blue label that I think was only used once (to talk about the original .es domain hack)
