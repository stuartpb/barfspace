# Cruise cover letters

for positions:

- [Senior Frontend Engineer - PaaS](https://boards.greenhouse.io/cruise/jobs/1674568?gh_jid=1674568)
- [Senior Software Engineer - Product](https://boards.greenhouse.io/cruise/jobs/1669848?gh_jid=1669848)

## let's take a shot at writing one letter for both

I want to see a world without driving. Not only for the convenience to passengers, or the efficiency of an autonomous fleet that can be provisioned on demand, but for safety.

I believe I would be an excellent fit for this position. Since 2012, I've made numerous frontend solutions, using three.js, WebSocket, and REST APIs

## I think these dues ghosted me
