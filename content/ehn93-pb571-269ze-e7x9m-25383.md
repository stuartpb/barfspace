# Vendoring

It's generally a good idea to keep dependencies out of your source tree, instead using something like a git submodule or package-lock.json to track their state and re-retrieve them as needed.

However, some times, that's overkill, or too complicated to figure out, or you need to make a small change to the file, or something like that.

When that happens, it's fine: we just go ahead and include the source file as part of our own tree, in a process known as **vendoring**.

When you copy files from another source tree for use in your own, you should place it in a directory called `vendor`, so tools like GitHub's Linguist (the thing that tracks how much code in your project is of one kind or another) know not to count it as a file you authored.
