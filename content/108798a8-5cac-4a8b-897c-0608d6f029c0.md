# Procedures and Praxis

A friend of mine tried to get me into D&D once, but I told him I wasn't into it: I wasn't the type to get into all that mathy, abstract stuff.

That's not how a good game of D&D goes, though, he told me. A good game of D&D is just like a game of make-believe: everybody at the table just makes up something they'd like to do, and the DM uses those rules to *simulate* what they described.

"But at that point, why have the DM at all?", I said, my mind always striving toward anarchy. "Why not just spitball without any rules?"

"For the same reason games of make-believe always fell apart when we were kids," he told me: "if you're making it all up based on gut feelings, then everybody just wants everything to go their way when it suits them."

"Even when you're not playing *against* each other, the rules keep you grounded in reality - they force you to confront the real shortcomings with a plan like 'I jump ten feet over the fence and immediately shoot all six guards in the head'."

This stuck with me, and it's been the model for D&D's modern messaging today.

Anyway, I'm not here to talk about the rules of Dungeons & Dragons: I'm here to talk about Robert's Rules of Order.

## skipping ahead a bit

You should not

Beware of [all the stuff on this page](7aecb2c6-18e8-4967-9447-e743ebc003ec.md)

The purpose of the deep documented procedures is to **restore** trust in both parties operating in good faith. If the way your members use the rules make people feel confused and outflanked by an underhanded elite, *your organization has eaten itself*, and anybody who wants to get shit done should ditch it before it disappears like a black hole up its own asshole.

## more skipping ahead, put somewhere around "But aren't the rules going to force us into a corner?"

And you can always motion to suspend the rules for something both parties are willing to agree on if it doesn't fit the mold.

## What's wrong with Robert's Rules?

The main issue: even though the original archaic editions are public domain, the modern editions are not copyleft, or even easily accessible: it's only available commercially, in paper books (or on - get this - *[CD-ROM](https://www.amlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Robert-Rules-Order-Form_2015.pdf)*.)

There isn't really a modern open-source parliamentary procedure - there are hardly even other competing bodies of work. The next most popular is the Sturgis [Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Standard_Code_of_Parliamentary_Procedure) from the American Institute of Parliamentarians, and to give you an idea of the spirit it was created in, it has a guide to using its rules in bad faith *on the inside back cover*.

In short, ther's a lot of baggage around the kind of writing

## Why not just Rusty's Rules?
