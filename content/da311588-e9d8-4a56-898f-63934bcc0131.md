can incorporate references to specific endeavors as examples, and incorporate artifacts. This covers everything outside these notes: work put together outside this tree since its creation is documented in cooperation with [The Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md)

And, of course, this page is as much about how my content model is *evolving* (or at least it should work in lockstep with that thinking), because [News is History](3e6b05c2-7cd7-40a3-b16f-35e81c844718.md)

- [this node on continuations from OneNote](8730a487-7d29-48d9-a197-5c90bd83df82.md) developed in conjunction with the [Deep Note Divers](acea3fb8-4b0d-434e-aefd-3a75ced4f0a2.md)
