# Loose app ideas

- GitHub Organization Migration Archive Dashboard.
  - Creates a dashboard for a user with a jillion organizations like me
  - provides a UI for downloading tarballs via https://developer.github.com/v3/migrations/orgs/
- a nicer pacman wrapper, as described [here](8b80e03e-30e6-4b56-ae65-4c9439a2b061.md)
