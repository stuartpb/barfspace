# stustudio network numbering plan

branching off from thoughts [here](b9a55188-647f-4cd0-ab69-6df7e25ccb24.md)

I have a numbering plan for my internal network, and I've been keeping it proprietary, but, I mean, screw it, there's more to be learned from the best practices going into this

## related stuff I should write

TODO: build a "ranges to avoid" reference to cover stuff like "most routers pick these" or "some devices default to these" or "minikube uses this range"

also, an explainer of how these addresses work for people just getting into this stuff (ie. how IPv6 would completely make this a thing of the past) would be *dynamite*

## 192.168.0.0/25: DHCP reservations

- 192.168.0.23: studtop ethernet adapter
  - as this is a MAC-based reservation for a USB device, this address can migrate by plugging the hub into a different machine
  - the Ethernet adapter is also a hub with storage plugged into it
    - as such, you can thusly kind of think of the Ethernet stick as the body of the system
      -  the underlying compute node is hot-swappable
        - this would be REALLY true if we didn't use the node's onboard storage a *little*
- 192.168.0.37: studtop (wireless interface)
  - not in use
  - still reserved in case of emergency
    - ie. if we migrate the wired adapter somewhere else and need to access studtop, we can still do it wirelessly
- 192.168.0.33: stuflair
- 192.168.0.54: stuixel
  - my phone, its number ending in 0054
- 192.168.0.79: abe
  - Primer's runtime being 79 minutes
- 192.168.0.83: unnamed octopi
- 192.168.0.99: stuzzy
- 192.168.0.101: stushiba/stutendo
- 192.168.0.117: Misty II ("Misty Chief")

If this range ever fills up too much, I'll probably start allocating more DHCP reservations starting with the 192.168.8.0/24

If that happens, my "terminals" / "desktops" will be the ones keeping 192.168.0.0/25, and stuff like servers (abe, octopi, stuflair, studtop) will probably get kicked to the higher ring

## 192.168.0.128-192.168.0.250: DHCP up-for-grabs dynamic pool

I'm using this, and not a different pool, because these IPs do have a way of working their way into configs ("soft reservations" and all), and I'd rather not have 192.168.6.0/24 be the "headers-that-arbitrarily-start-with-X" of those adoptions.

## 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.2.255: Reserved

Some devices do put themselves at 192.168.1.1, or 192.168.1.2 or thereabouts: this ensures we won't have any address conflicts.

## 192.168.3.0 - 192.168.7.255: On-Device Static IPs (if needed)

These are for IP Addresses that aren't provisioned by DHCP

6 and 7 may be Static Wireless and Static Wired

reminder that devices using these should still send out a DHCP INFORM where possible

## 192.168.32.0 - 192.168.32.250: Stubernetes "household-internal-dynamic" MetalLB pool

this was originally going to be 192.168.32.0-192.168.63.355 but I realized that was absurdly large

## 192.168.42.0 - 192.168.42.250: Stubernetes household-internal static service assignments

- 192.168.42.53: DNS server
- 192.168.42.80: internal ingress (not yet used)

## 192.168.63.0/24: reserved for "exposed service" IPs

not sure if I'm going to use this yet
