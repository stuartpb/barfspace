# Department of Barfspace

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way.

It'll also probably turn into a nexus for the codification of processes that get followed in these notes somewhat? IDK, that might be implying more cohesion to this editing than can ever really be hoped for

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo][OBR].

## The Quests

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests][] was eventually divided up into three "domains":

- [Barfspace Operations][], dealing with legacies, maintenance and the like
- [Barfspace Visions][], dealing with new explanatory content and structure, aspirations like that
- [Barfspace Implementations][], dealing with tooling etc

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md
[Barfspace Operations]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[Barfspace Visions]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md
[Barfspace Implementations]: 30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md

These are kind of... artifact-y, as a lot of them are kind of... inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

In fact...

The more I think about it, the more I think Barfspace Visions should be broken into subpages that are all kept in a section here, as well as Operations (which would get integrated into the list below). The pages can list the thesis of each of these "divisions", and all the content can live in linkable subpages.

Maybe in a new commit soon. (actually, eh whatever I'll start doing it now)

## Operation Headquarters and Reflection Points

- [Operation Trapper Keeper](1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md)
  - [Camp Papalima](4f705b65-cc3c-4f66-a256-ae5e5777d276.md) for Importing the Petlogs
- the Historical Strike Force Alpha plan being hatched in [how-i-roll's Tomb][] ("History Force")
- [The Right Near Office][TOTNE] (Thoughts on the First List of the Root Note)
- [The Edge Surveyors][etc](Thoughs on Miscellanea and the Last and Latter Lists of the Root Note)
  - [Collecting Links and Putting Them Somewhere][CLAPTS] (Organizing and Expanding the Linkdump)
- [The Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md) (Covering notes outside this note structure, how they're operating, links or why you can't see them, etc)
  - Old GitHub structure doesn't count, that's just an adjunct operation within the mainline historian duties (though that will probably be a focus of the how-i-roll Trapper Keeper work)
  - This will probably start a joint venture with History Force for documenting archaeology into older note structures like OneNote and Trello
  - The Beyonder Consulate always has a close relationship/rivalry with Operation Trapper Keeper, which wants to integrate notes, and especially those in foreign historic predecessors: having the Beyonder Consulate do a thorough documentation job makes it easier to pass off to History Force without having to go through Archaeology Corps
- [what's bappin' with musings](8fa02640-b218-40d4-8948-18bf0d441b22.md) (this will probably get a fancy division name at some point, and also probably drift apart from the Depart of Barfspace to become like the People's Free Insurgent Army of True Barfspace or some Temple of Barfspace thing or something)

## Aspirational Plans and Reflections / Prophecies and Brainwaves

- [Federating Barfspace](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md)
- [Lean Notes and Linkdumps](1cd51f38-b2df-49a5-99ad-b5629b3083b0.md) (kind of an artifact these days)
- [The Quest in the Quotes](73bf679b-4732-4ed1-929d-5dce9c163fd7.md) (a weird cluster of thoughts that isn't really a quest)

## Descriptional and Perscriptional Drafting

Examining my process enough to codify it has a weird way of leading to me trying to draftt new stronger rules for things I was only vaguely and inconsistently doing, so these tend to trade back and forth between descriptive and perscriptive

For more of this kind of process-examination-and-specification, check out the [Spec Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), which might get a joint-venture dedicated page for the describing-notes-as-they-work-in-this-repo documentation?
