# What is this book?

This book is a comic that shows what the language represents. Just like how a storybook might say "George put on the yellow hat" in the English language on a page with a drawing of George putting on the yellow hat, this comic has an operation described in the Lua language with a drawing of that operation being taken, in an abstract-yet-tangible world that corresponds to the world of things the language describes.

The syntax will use the longhand versions of all the actions I take, to make things easier if you're skipping around after the initial explanation, so I don't introduce syntactic sugar at some point where the underlying concept is fleshed out enough to explain the syntactic concept and then start using it without its meaning being clear. (That said, I might do comments above some of these saying something like "more simply, os.print")
