# fun observations/adventutes on gitpod and theia

I accidentally a bunch of orphan files into this repo, and I'm not sure how much of it is based on `gp open` choking on opening non-existent filenames? is that a bug that should be reported? maybe `--touch` needs to be an option to conjure so it can touch-then-open (and touch+print will remain the default behavior)

I also just see `gp open` fail with no explanation?
