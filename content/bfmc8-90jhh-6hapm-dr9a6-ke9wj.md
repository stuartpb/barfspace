# Untitled Trapped in the Office Game (formerly "titled" Robocopier)

Operator style text adventure on the phone with an intern who's trapped in the office: their speaker is broken, so you have to communicate with them via typing, but you hear everything going on with them

at one point you have to coerce a mouse to do something, and it's introduced as "I'm gonna need to find the mouse to use this computer, his name is Cornelius and he does not like sharing cheese"

I'm thinking this could be prototyped live a la Sleep is Death? ie. I go in the other room and simulate being the guy on the phone with you

anyway, the final idea for this is sort like an FMV game, but only with audio, which I think, like, Dr. Langeskov showed that that can be hilarious and compelling
