# Other Voyager model numbers / identifiers

I'm realizing now that the variations in Voyagers are subtle, not openly distinguished by most retailers, but important.

The Voyager line seems to (mostly?) share a model number of **RCT6873W42**, with the keyboard variants having the model number RCT6873W42**KC**.

## Intel Atom vs. MediaTek

This is the core difference: the two devices have completely different architectures.

However, it seems like the two chipsets have been placed in **the exact same plastic housing**, which has the model number of the device embossed on it, so there's **no outward way to tell which unit you have**.

However, there *might* be a way to tell from the packaging, based on the distinctions described below. (And, of course, if you already own it, you can find stuff from the device info via USB and system software)

## Revision number

Like, my unit is an F9 - it's circled, and to the right of the model number on the end of the box, by the bar code.

If you can find this, that's swell, and you've probably got all the information you need: however, if you're shopping online, you probably can't see that part of the box, and have to cue off of

## Physical differences

Non-KC variants don't seem to have the keyboard connector on the bottom edge, unsurprisingly

Older keyboard cases have narrower rectangular slots along the top instead of the bigger ones like the F9 I have

I'm hearing that some of these don't have hardware volume buttons (which'd explain why the screen has softbuttons for them I guess)? the KC one I have definitely does, and I'm pretty sure I've seen the non-KC version to have them

## Identifying features

Some portals advertise the device as coming with Android 6: these might be Atom units? They definitely have the squatter top holes in the keyboard case
