Notable logs:

- [Day 2](1558a75c-b543-452d-a119-d584595479ab.md)
- ran into a problem where the files in the PVC stopped working.
  - it's got me spooked so I'm gonna push this commit now, and then I'll work on the overall cluster sprint that adds Loki for logging to review the case if it happens again
