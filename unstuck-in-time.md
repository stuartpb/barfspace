This is a thing I've been thinking about lately and should probably expand into something more somewhere, but for right now I'm just going to try unspooling it into barfspace

Keep a Changelog isn't enough for me, because it doesn't cover changes on the order that fledgling projects tend to go through - massive, gravitational shifts from single repos into entire organizations, stuff like that.

What I'd like is something covering what I'm looking at doing with OPWS, having an "opws-news" repo that's going to contain history and updates, but, like, in a way that scales down to individual repos better.

There's also the manner of having roadmap files that I'm not convinced is right? Like, I think having a "roadmap issue", or milestone, or projects, is better...

That's another thing, the interplay of milestones versus projects. I think that's one of the reasons I was thinking of doing "GitHub Best Practices", to clarify some of that. Now that it's "GitHub Mistakes", I guess it could be formulated
