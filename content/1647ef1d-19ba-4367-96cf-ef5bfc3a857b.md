# Magic Band Infinity Gauntlet page

reminder that I should check if there's a quests page for this, and either link or move that quest to here

oh, right, it's [here][3dpq], which is listed on the main Projects page. I'll move some stuff around with that in a coming commit.

so, I've made the basic version of a model for this, but if it's going to take an eighth of my gold filament (UPDATE: more like a tenth), maybe I should make the model a bit more full-featured (and also maybe prototype it in the brass filament that I care less about)?

from the first revision (which I don't think I've committed yet,as I accidentally did it on half the assembly instead of the whole one), I'm thinking I'll print this part of the gauntlet with the footprint of the holder cut in half, and only the lower part included as part of the model (kind of like how the back of a MagicBand's holder itself is removable), with three holes for wires and/or screws (eg. 2 wires and one screw per side, possibly) from the back within the outline of the holder. This will be able to hold:

- The outer ring for the holder (friction fit into the slot, or screwed in / elastic if that doesn't work out for some reason)
- A plug that fills in the "original" design for the gauntlet from that point on the surface up (as the holder part will only be part of the gauntlet on the inside)
- A "hybrid" design that puts the Mind Stone cover on top of the MagicBand icon, possibly with some kind of coil to detect NFC and a few LEDs to light up
- (in a theoretical redesign for compatibility that I don't feel like doing, or possibly concidence our of dumb luck) The back-of-band holder from an actual MagicBand

ah heck, we might as well make it 4, that way we could potentially use the holes for armature to the fingers. also do SPI or whatever

looking at the design now, I notice that

a quick thing I did was move the gauntlet down by .5 (or move this up) and then this cylinder fits the circular carveout almost perfectly:

```scad
cylinder(d=40, h=6);
```

I might even be so bold as to just target the footprint of the inside and use the design there as the lip itself.

having a nice round cylinder as the base has a few more perks:

- the base can be resized for tolerance
- the entire surface can be redesigned (ie. I can just use a flat plane, rather than intersecting the little bits of the stone holder that remain in the current design)
- mixed-material concepts like a TPU socket won't look as jarring
- more room if I decide I actually want to raise the icon part higher (I can design a whole new second level)

I'm even considering knocking out this entire piece of the gauntlet solid, but... eh... maybe I'll make it like a GIANT version of the original socket, with a smaller hole for the "back of the part" (maybe shaped to assist orientation - I'm thinking an echo of the original oval, but larger so it's enough to fit the MagicBand icon holder), and then, hey, maybe I could have the whole piece holding the icon be one big removable part. that way, I can just snap (ba dum tss) it in, like the orignal holder design, or I can print a multi-layer assembly, or whatever - including more complex circuitry holders
