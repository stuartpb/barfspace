# borkflowy markdown reader

It's like Workflowy, but with Bagtent as a backing store

So the central idea is, you'd be able to click and expand any link, and it'll expand immediately after the paragraph / list item by insertion (so basically, this is an alternative to breadcrumb navigation, where it's "accordion navigation")

and to fuck with links, you can press the button, and any "innermost" expansion can be edited as raw Markdown

## boxesin wistful musing

this is sort of one offshoot of an idea that I originally conceptualized as "boxesin"

the other one, [Squorum](80c01468-5a12-4496-90f0-64abad259156.md), reminds me of one key thing this would need to support: *moving content around*, from one place in one note to another place in another note (possibly linked from the first one). That was a big idea in the original boxesin design, and this wouldn't be much of a workflowy if there weren't ways to do that

## Understanding the "Accordion":

This [Jam about Threads](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md) footnote sums it up: a "long-ass document" can be an easier user experience than a bunch of disjointed and arbitrarily-positioned tabs. Imagine if a page linked in multiple places just had multiple points in the document where you could edit it (ie. anywhere it was linked)? And you could jump from file to file with just a "Ctrl+f"!

This also resembles how Literate Programming works...
