# The Easter Witch

[The Engine](kcmem-sb3en-8p83r-pfk3k-db63r) lays out the idea of how the world operates

This is a sibling story to [wolf5d](fm1es-hhxbt-whb09-tzvd0-g8we4) [The Unexpected End of Jason Innput](5nbdc-8qh61-mr92r-tpbh9-54gpn) is a short story I'm drafting in this setting

## Character name

Batty Buddhabone (an approximate Chinese translation of "ba di fo gu")

Real name Bati Budabon? Damn what country is that?

- Something in Eastern Europe?
  - Turkey? Hungary? (no thanks I just had lunch)
  - Transsssylvania?
- Somewhere in Asia?
  - The Middle East?
    - India? Pakistan?
  - The Phillipines?
  - Vietnam?
- Is her actual name "Batty"?
  - Is that her drag name or something?
  - Is she a 50s pinup girl?

## Influences

On top of the specific influences on UEJI, the Osterhex side of what I'm

- Buffy / Supernatural
- The Matrix
- Westworld
- Black Mirror
  - USS Callister especially (I almost feel like this goes without saying)
  - though actually the whole "consciousness inserted into female avatar makes dude realize he's not really a dude" thing is like that plot that they teased but didn't pay off in Striking Vipers
