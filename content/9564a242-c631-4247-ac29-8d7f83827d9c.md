I'm thinking it'd be useful to keep a list of all the outreach messages I've written in applying to positions and such

> Hi [Aerial]! We met at the Seattle JS meetup a while back, where you described using Raspberry Pi devices to manage open conference rooms. Your team at [Cloudscapes] sounded pretty interesting, and I'm looking for work right now, so I figured I would connect with you to ask about openings.

## Indeed interested message

This is something I wrote in response to a "Tell this employer why you're interested" on Indeed:

> This position looks like a perfect fit for me: on top of my skills in frontend development, I have extensive experience with Docker and git on Linux servers (having built an entire Heroku-compatible push-based deployment system), a thorough knowledge of security best practices (I wrote a humor article on cybersecurity for Cracked.com eight years ago that still holds up today), and a natural knack for uncovering edge cases in testing (I discovered a build-breaking bug in Chrome's shipping implementation of ES6 arrow functions that Google themselves had missed).

## cut answer to "What interests you about working in a start-up environment?"

Larger enterprises often apply an oppressive, monolithic "one and only way" to all their internal development, which lead to stultification as the state of the art of the world outside progresses beyond the relative wasteland of archaic institutions that self-perpetuate within these ecosystems.

### revamped answer

The flexibility, autonomy, and agility around how solutions can be developed. Large corporations can be set in their ways, which frequently lag behind the state of the art that more nimble startups are able to pursue.
