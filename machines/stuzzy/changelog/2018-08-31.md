I want to screw with some partitions, so `sudo pacman -S gparted` (and also `ntfs-3g` and `gpart`, as I need the former to interact with the device I will be saving images to, and the latter just sounds useful).

Imaged my first Chromebook's storage to my archival / backup drive (because, hey, neat artifact) via `sudo dd if=/dev/sdc conv=sync bs=8MiB status=progress | gzip -c > /run/media/stuart/ateworld/images/c720p.img.gz`; it took 4400 seconds. Maybe I should have done `sudo fdisk -l /dev/sdc > /run/media/stuart/ateworld/images/c720p_fdisk.info` first:

```
Disk /dev/sdc: 29.8 GiB, 32017047552 bytes, 62533296 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 33553920 bytes
```

D'oh. Well, anyway, it's done now.

## Bootstrapping a new sturling

`sudo pacman -S arch-install-scripts`

From here, I'm going to fork off to a changelog for this new sturling installation
