# Infrastructure Project Ideas

These are ideas for services that would help facilitate other projects

- [A local-Let's-Encrypt-certificate-provisioning service](af61f26f-4813-4473-9550-cc038de75965.md)
- [Parked Project (Redux)](416491ee-4b52-4887-96f0-465f361a36ea.md)
- itself.co
- [Quadration](0d93d812-6739-4142-9e16-d686e6df00ef.md)

## Other adjacent kind of project theme indices

The [top-level project idea list](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) has a lot of other kinds of projects that could be seen as "infrastructure" that aren't the kind of infrastructure I'm talking about here, such as:

- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](d78bdabf-6401-489e-a284-51c500826748.md)
- [Components, Features, and Parts](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md)
- [Community Wishlist](cbf8b20c-fd72-4c42-a543-952e046c893b.md)
- [Method Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md)

## honorable mention

- [plushu](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md) would probably be useful for all of the above
- Rogueport was an extension to add hackable APIs to sites that didn't expose them, that's gotta be a class of infrastructure-like endeavor
- [the glass tubes iteration of what became Lean Notes](0350c64c-4975-42fc-91ca-92007cd9bcaa.md) was meant to be like an "Infrastructure-in-a-box Starter Service"
