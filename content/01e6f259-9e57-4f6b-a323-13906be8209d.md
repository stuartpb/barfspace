# The thing about letting content go stale

Old writing that hasn't been updated in a while is just a symptom of old *thoughts* that haven't been updated in a while.

I can rewrite an old opinion at a newer point in time if I haven't revisited the corresponding node.

Hence, it's easier to tell how relevant writing is by *how linked into the context it is*: inaccurate writing is often a symptom of not-really-paying-much-attention as much as it is being just "old".
