# News is History

This is a thing I've been thinking about lately and should probably expand into something more somewhere, but for right now I'm just going to try unspooling it into barfspace

Keep a Changelog isn't enough for me, because it doesn't cover changes on the order that fledgling projects tend to go through - massive, gravitational shifts from single repos into entire organizations, stuff like that.

What I'd like is something covering what I'm looking at doing with [OPWS][], having an "opws-news" repo that's going to contain history and updates, but, like, in a way that scales down to individual repos better.

There's also the manner of having roadmap files that I'm not convinced is right? Like, I think having a "roadmap issue", or milestone, or projects, is better...

That's another thing, the interplay of milestones versus projects. I think that's one of the reasons I was thinking of doing "GitHub Best Practices", to clarify some of that. Now that it's "GitHub Mistakes", I guess it could be formulated as a mistake people make, not keeping an accessible description of the changes in their project between versions

Really this is just me reflecting on the thing that Keep a Changelog noted, which is that the file in GNU projects that constitures what's described as a "changelog" there is the one that's called `NEWS`, and what that implies about how the difference between the two concepts is just a matter of [spelling][], really
