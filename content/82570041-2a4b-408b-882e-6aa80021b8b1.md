- [reitteck 170mm rock tumbler polishing kit](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4076827)
  - I'm thinking this could be useful for smoothing parts (namely the NeckFX beads)
  - sourcing vitamins:
    - [IKEA jar](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/ikea-365-jar-with-lid-glass-plastic-s19277767/) is $7
      - hey, what if this were just a few sheets of plastic held together by gears on both sides?
    - Silicon carbide:
      - https://www.amazon.com/s?k=silicon+carbide+powder+set
        - [$23, 3 pounds, 4 steps](https://www.amazon.com/Polly-Plastics-Tumbler-Tumbling-Resealable/dp/B075MY9P8Z/)
          - chintzy bags
        - [$25, 3.5 pounds, 4 steps + filler](https://www.amazon.com/Dan-Darci-Rock-Tumbler-Refill/dp/B07Z7K41CN/)
          - spiffy bottles
        - not sure about 5 steps like OP describes
        - [they say it'll last as long as you care to keep it](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3666116/comments#comment-2678030)
    - [the old version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3666116) lists the other parts
      - motor:
        - [specs of original motor per Google Translate](7aca3153-d31a-4e40-a109-0036dd9f266f.md)
        - seems like [this $15 one](https://www.amazon.com/Greartisan-el%C3%A9ctrico-reducci%C3%B3n-velocidad-exc%C3%A9ntrico/dp/B072N84JX7) should be analagous
          - reviews explicitly say it's good for rock tumbling
        - [more motor tips](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3666116/comments#comment-2710529)
          - might actually want to go for a maybe-speed-lowered 100 RPM
      - the comments talk about screws?
        - [this one](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3666116/comments#comment-2875477) suggests:
          - 12x M2x12 for the casing
          - 4x M5x16 for the base
        - [this model](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4411870) says it's a version of the base without screws

Oof, after looking at all this, it's like, why would I bother with sourcing all this when I can just buy an actual rock tumbler (with powder, a soundproofed jar, and even some starter rocks) for $40? If I want to try making my own assembly (what, is the jar bigger or something?), I can do it by modifying the base rock tumbler, duh.
