# Big Works in Progress

This is for stuff that, at some point, seemed like a big undertaking I'd try to do instead of writing notes first.

[Visitor's Center Tour][VCT] is another page kind of like this one, I guess? It's maybe a "post-barfspace" version of this, I don't know. We'll see how shit shakes out.

Okay, you know what, this page is still kind of garbage, there are a bunch more pages like these but they're all listed under a new heading on the newly-merged-together [meditations][] page from the post-Lean-Notes-merger-merger, so if you want the rest of what would have gone here, go over there.

## [exit codes][]

Documentation for the standard reasons I'd exit a thread (read: conversation).

You know that thing where someone's just being incredibly tedious and awful, so you just want to walk away? This is for that, except the idea is that you can drop a hyperlink to help them better understand *why* they're being tedious, and what they could do to *not* be tedious in the future.

## [Waxhead Revisited][]

A gonzo walkthrough for cheesy 90s FMV point-and-click adventure game [Are You Afraid of the Dark? The Tale of Orpheo's Curse](http://orpheoscurse.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tale_of_Orpheo's_Curse), to give me an outlet for florid prose for when I'm feeling nostalgic and/and drunk.

## [western-civilization-walkthrough.txt][walkthrough]

This is supposed to be a joke in the vein of the [GameFAQs walkthrough for Problem Sleuth](http://www.mspaintadventures.com/?s=4&p=000816) (maybe crossed with [this t-shirt](https://www.topatoco.com/bestshirtever/)), where it gives the "strategy" for "winning" at various points in human civilization. 90% of the "strategies" are basically "be born in the right place at the right time", and the rest is "commit atrocities on indigineous peoples for 9/10 of the game, then symbolically atone at the last minute so you can claim reparations are uncalled for".

The idea is that, like, if you went back in history, all the figures would be the Greatest Players, who all followed the advice in the strategy guide to win dominance. Basically, it's just a list of "winning" "strategies" throughout history. (Maybe calling it "Walkthrough" was dumb, and now that I've identified that glitch I can resuscitate this idea under the umbrella of a "Strategy Guide" for the "Campaign" of human civilization: the "Western Civilization" scope thing was kind of a gag that didn't land.)
