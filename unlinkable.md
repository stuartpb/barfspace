# Things I Can't Easily Link To Because of Old-World "Intellectual Property" Nonsense

## Tim pitching "The Bear" on Spaced

From S01E01, "Beginnings" (full transcript [here](http://transcriptvids.com/v/9CL7QETJNk0.html) with a dead YouTube link)

```fountain
TIM is showing DAISY some sketches from his unpublished comics series, "The Bear".

TIM
This guy's called the Bear, he's like a mutant.
He's essentially a nice guy but he's driven to violence by the society he inhabits.

DAISY
Right. Who's that, then?

TIM
That's Doktor Mandrake.

DAISY
Doctor Mandrake.

TIM
Dok-tor Mandrake, it's got a K in it.
He's a mad scientist. He invented this steroid called oxypheromalkahyde.
He tested it on this orphan kid but it didn't work, did it?
So he chucked out his research, chucked the kid out onto the street,
but when the kid reached puberty,
the dormant oxypheromalkahyde interrupted DNA coding and he mutated into the Bear.
Doktor Mandrake has dedicated his life to capturing the Bear
to rediscover the effects of oxypheromalkahyde.

DAISY
So, why didn't the doctor just make the oxypoxydrin again?

TIM
Well... because he'd invented it by accident, didn't he?

TIM shows Daisy several more sketches he's drawn.

TIM
These mutants are mistakes he's made as he's tried to recreate the serum.
Like, see, that guy's got a really big head.

DAISY
Oh.

TIM
So, do you like my comic?

DAISY
Yeah. Yeah.
(beat)
That reminds me, I was talking to Marsha about the rubbish.

The line about "because he'd invented it by accident" is something I really wanted to link to for "the results of reckless experimentation" in https://github.com/stuartpb/sacred-tenets/commit/a4baae577dc3c014cdb5641af20d138e1859377d
