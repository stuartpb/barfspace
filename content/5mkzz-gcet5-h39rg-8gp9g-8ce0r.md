This is a Journeys page to see what makes sense if I want to run a non-pet-machine deployment system for IoT stuff: how much Balena makes sense vs, I don't know, just raw Kubernetes or whatever

https://www.balena.io/ caught my eye with their Etcher stuff (I think their company's name used to be Resin? I guess they pivoted)
