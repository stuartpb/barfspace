# Prometheus the Issue Genius

If you've got Loki and Prometheus running in an app that has something going wrong, you can go into a "timeline view" and select which classes of event you think are relevant to the issue - I feel like this'd be way better than a Firefox-style "Oh no! Submit a dump and we'll see if this looks like anything"

Like, this'd be for straight-up filing a new issue on a repo (and searching against it first, too - there could even be a "find similar issues" to, like, find some kind of autofix)

this also kind of starts to tie into Kublam
