# Bells on their Toes: Procedure Projects and Perceptual Pitches

This is somewhere between Lean Notes protips, Projects, and Musings (especially the [big ones][] in which they share the original impulse of having dedicated repos created for them in the Pre-Notes Era of [My Old Bad Ideas][MOBI]), as well as the [Wellness and Fitness index][WAFI] and some degree of all the other stuff that's linked off from Right Now

[WAFI]: 2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md
[MOBI]: f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md

This is for experiments and concepts

What gets drafted here: procedures, standards, guidelines... all that fun boring stuff
