# Proquint Naming Thing

Okay, so, you'd have a language where everything is consonant-vowel pairs, like Japanese. the [sounds and symbols from Proquints](https://arxiv.org/html/0901.4016#_conclusion_and_specification) (`bdfghjklmnprstvz` + `aiou`) seem as good a basis as any

[this could be written in a kind of cuneiform](krzms-bftem-4pa51-9wary-c3bc7)

anyway, everybody has a four-consonant-and-vowel-pair-syllable (ie. 64-bit) first and last name, and a proquint (ie. 16-bit) middle name

example: Mozaroni Zokap-pudij Dadonotu

## cultural variation

one of the ideas here is that the name generation is heavily locality-specific, but the ultimate naming format is uniform across the setting. like how lots of cultures use different calendars, but they've all coalesced around seven-day weeks for some degree of intercompatibility

charting out the different implications of different systems and how they reflect the cultures that use them is p interesting to consider imo

## first name

so kids would be born with a random seed coming from... maybe you flip a coin every 45 minutes for the first 24 hours of their life, and that's their first name.

or maybe it's an hourglass with a wedge, and every 45 minutes a ball falls down on one side or the other of the wedge?

or maybe you just toss 32 ordered, two-sided stones into the air. that's certainly punchier

## last name

I was thinking last name would be assembled from the parents, with first and second syllables coming from the first syllables of the first and last names of the parent giving birth (determined by some kind of social proximity in cases of surrogacy), and the third and fourth coming from the same from the other parent.

The core idea is that names would be genetic like this. The both-parents-contribute-equally-to-the-name thing is fixed, but maybe different castes/regions follow different rules that reflect cultural attitudes (like using the first and third syllable of last names, or a different syllable from the first and last name for each parent)

## middle name

anyway, you'd also have a two-word middle name, where each word goes consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant, that the kid picks for themselves in a coming-of-age ceremony. until that time, kids don't have middle names: if there's some kind of tried-as-an-adult scenario that calls for it, they're named as "babab-babab", meaning 0x00000000 (also, "babab" means "baby")

## all together

and so that's generally how things work: people are addressed by their first name as a random identifier, but in social settings, are more generally called by their "handle"

names are expected to never change - to change any part of one's name is to become a completely different person in the eyes of the law (to the point that they'll think the person with your old name has gone missing, and will pursue them)
