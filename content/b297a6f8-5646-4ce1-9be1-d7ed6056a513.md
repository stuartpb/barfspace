# Pitches and Scripts

This is an index page for various creative-writing-type pieces I write - spec scripts for TV shows, one-off loglines for sketches, stuff like that.

They're usually not that throuoghly developed because they're, you know, exercises. But the pieces might be usable for other things.

I've split this page in two:

- ["Original" work](a8a866de-058d-4729-86f0-57088d744e28.md)
- ["Derivative" work](bf409581-d752-437a-a086-60002a0f6889.md)

On the entirely superficial difference between the two: [On Fanfiction](bd72f20b-397c-4908-9112-1a86e073c492.md)

## Detritus

Here's [a page with lots of little exchanges apropos of nothing that might go somewhere, IDK](46859426-4cd3-42b5-8b16-63d65fba20b8.md)
