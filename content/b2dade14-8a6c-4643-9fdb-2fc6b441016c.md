### mixed data stuff

I recommend having a restriction against any two data types (content, authors, assets, etc) share a UUID if one isn't directly defined by the other (though things like a scheme where there's a subdirectory of assets as attachments to content, it's OK to structure those by UUID of the content they're attached to, as that's not a structure the way "an asset" is)

reminder to think about the scenario where Fountain is in here, too, for when Pitches and Scripts gets real
