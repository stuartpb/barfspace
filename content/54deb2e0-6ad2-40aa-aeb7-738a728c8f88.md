# Painting Palette Party

## handedness

http://karinwells.blogspot.com/2009/07/blog-post.html

hole should be lower than indent, on the side of the palette as the hand you paint with - it sits on your off hand, and your index finger's palm knuckle should be in the recess

[this post](https://karenbjones.com/tag/how-to-hold-a-painters-palette/) is, I'm pretty sure, wrong

## issues with this one from Thingiverse

- it's backwards
- it's a gross parody of the palette it's imitating, depth-wise
- thumb hole is small and uncomfortable
- pokey underbits

## other possible improvements

- integrated tool/brush holder

## hold up

I'm seeing stuff suggesting I might want to look into "wet palettes"
