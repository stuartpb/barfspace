# Ruining a Good Thing by Naming It

a series / collection on things that only magically work when they're not clearly defined or mechanical, you know.

- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflexivity_(social_theory) is probably the term I'm looking for
  - wow, just like Recuperation, I didn't realize there was a solid existing body of research on this subject
  - Wait, okay, reading the page a little more, it sounds like this is a broader concept. Maybe the subset would be "Toxic Reflexivity"?
  - lol George Soros is into this

## not a Wikipedia page

Freakonomics covers this kind of thing a bit: the defining example was a daycare that instituted a fee for leaving kids after pickup time, leading in *more* parents leaving their kid after hours, because the concrete fee replaced the implicit shame they risked when it was just a rule with no penalty.

if wikipedia has a thing on this, research has shown that extrinsic rewards do this in a lot of cases

## sidebar: Tinkerbells

Having a formalized system in place can lead to the formality being the only remaining vestige of a thing that no longer exists, which may conceal the vanishing of that thing.
