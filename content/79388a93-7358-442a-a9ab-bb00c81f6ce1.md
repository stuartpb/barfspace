- Imagination in Six Steps: How Scott McCloud Illuminates Comics' Dance with the Audience

## Beats

showing only parts allows the audience to better understand the whole

they bring what they know, in their minds' own (wordless) words

the trick is to ensure that we're conveying the details enough that the audience will be able to fill in the gaps

widening a gap between panels can help better bridge a gap between heads

icons are parts and symbols coming to stand for something larger regardless of relation to the icon

Brook suggested it as a topic, and I thought that'd be a really great subject, since Understanding Comics really just fundamentally changed my outlook on, well, pretty much everything.

These concepts are existential, and this is really just going to be a ten-minute overview of just one way at looking at the first few chapters, and I highly encourage people to read the book.

### Kickoff

I originally read this book for DigiPen, and I didn't quite get why it was required reading at a games school. Thinking back on it now, I get it, and here's why it makes sense for gamers, and for DigiPen students especially.

At some point before I read this book, I think I was of the opinion, as were many in the gaming community, that the key goal of all games - what we ultimately hoped for technologically, and what all games ought to strive for - was *realism*. The best games were the ones that had the most detailed graphics, the most realistic simulations, the most comprehensive controls. Gaming had been moving out of this mindset for a few years by the time I was in school, but there was still a kind of tension, where the people speaking in defense of cartoony games like The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker seemed to be just *settling for less*.

The thing I wasn't getting is that there are
