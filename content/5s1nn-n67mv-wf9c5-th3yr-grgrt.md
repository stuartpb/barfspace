note that https://www.filaments.directory/en/plastics rocks as of January 2020, this page of notes should maybe just get condensed into a cheat sheet? like "here's a reason you'd want to switch your nozzle to this material, here's a reason you'd want to switch away"

## ABS

[Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene][WP:ABS] was the first really easily available filament. It's strong, but it has a bunch of downsides that are fixed by newer filament types (among other things, you need an enclsure while printing it, as it's the only filament I know in modern use that produces toxic vapors when printed - due to the rubberized chemicals mixed into the material, melting ABS smells like a tire fire).

[WP:ABS]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_butadiene_styrene

These days, the only reason you'll be printing in ABS is because you've got a filament with some kind of enhancement that you can't find mixed into a more FFF-friendly material. PLA has solidly taken the top spot for general use, and PETG has seized what's left of durability-oriented printing. There's still some interest in ABS for vapor-smoothing, but even that is better handled by ASA.

## PLA

[PolyLactic Acid][WP:PLA] corn plastic that's crisp: will generally break before it bends. This can be a feature as much as it's a defect: breakaway support is easier to break away, and when a PLA part breaks, you can generally glue it back together.

## PETG

[PolyEthylene Terephthalate][WP:PET] with Glycol is the PET plastic you see used in drink bottles and stuff, with glycol mixed in to make it softer and more suitable for 3D printing.

PETG is the polar opposite of PLA in that it doesn't break, but it bends *easily*.

[Toms3D has a nice writeup on PETG](https://toms3d.org/2018/02/05/things-know-petg/)

## ASA

[Acrylonitrile styrene acrylate][WP:ASA] is the new ABS, from what I hear

[WP:ASA]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acrylonitrile_styrene_acrylate

## Nylon

hot and durable

## Polycarbonate

hot and... strong?

## Polypropylene

heehee you said PP

## TPU and TPE

Flexible.

I'm not 100% sure if there's a difference between TPU and TPE. I think there's more variance in different grades of the same stuff.

## PVA

Water-soluble support.

## HIPS

Limonene-soluble support.

## CPE

"CPE" is [what Ultimaker calls PETG](https://ultimaker.com/materials/cpe), from what I hear, so you might want to scroll up a bunch.

It can *also* stand for [Chlorinated PolyEthylene][WP:CPE], but I've really only seen [one filament like that](https://filament2print.com/gb/copolyesters-pet/890-cpe-hg100.html).

## Cleaning filament

I mean, you wouldn't *print* with it, but I should probably cover it nonetheless

## Rubber

Okay, this doesn't have much of anything to do with 3D printing beyond having some relevance to ABS/ASA, but [check out this page of rubber material summary][rubbers]. Neat, huh?
