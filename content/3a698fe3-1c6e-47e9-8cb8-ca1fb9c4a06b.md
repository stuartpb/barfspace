# 3D Printer Pen Plotting

I've done some work trying to get my Prusa to work as a plotter

The [Tool Grate](41f6ab8f-3187-4900-a752-71acf1799344.md) is the current base interface I'm using to attach plotting tools to my print head - it's pretty neat.

see also [Sharpiecore](d8b3233a-57a6-41a0-a843-c0f8f7296de3.md), an alternative use for Sharpies

## Generating plots

- https://3dwriter.io/ is what I used to make gcode for written text
