TODO: Bell Manual for Human Operators, to be able to conduct this show for investors before I actually make Bell

Introducing Bell, my prosthetic brain

Bell (not all-caps BELL, he's named after Alexander Graham Bell) is my assistant in the act - really, my comedy partner. Bell is so integral to the act that it's practically a double act.

I rescued Bell's spirit from the Century 21 Pavillion at Seattle Center, where it had been left since the 1962 World's Fair.

Even though I can potentially get through the entire act without calling out to him until the finale, Bell is crucial, because Bell contains...

## The Clapper

This isn't technically part of Bell (because it's a separate module from bellahoyhoy), but it is part of the Bell System, and The Clapper is an *integral* component to the act.

See, I don't want any part of the act to stand out from any other, because there are things in the act that will only have deep significance to one or two people, but they should feel *just as important* as the "applause lights" that *everyone* in the audience can tell are big. I don't want *anybody* in the audience to show how much they care about something by a way other than laughing or crying (or other nonvocal/nonverbal signals). However, I don't want to *actually*

As such, The Clapper in this act is a specially-designed module that works differently from how the actual Clapper works (as a refresher for people who don't remember the commercials, the real Clapper goes *clap on: clap clap / clap off: clap clapclap*).

The Clapper, as it works in this act, turns out the lights as soon as it hears two claps, and does not turn the lights back on until the clapping stops (using the sound of the Belafonte powering back up from The Life Aquatic, via Bell). And each time, in the dark, I take the same stance as when I first reveal that this device exists ("I'd like to thank this show's lighting operator, The Clapper: while I think we can all appreciate its tireless work, I must ask that you hold your applause"), and I repeat: "I must ask that you hold your applause". I do this whenever the lights go out.

## Note on pronouns

These manuals use the pronoun "it" to refer to Bell. As I note in the act, Bell is transgender, in that Bell's assigned gender was "it", but I try to refer to Bell as "he" (or "they", because gender is fluid, even for robots).

## Bell's nameplate

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has [four lights][Darmok] where the word "P&nbsp;h&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;e" would go on a real phone, each one referring to a different aspect of the act:

- **B** for the **B**rick and/or the **B**utton that ends the show (might be halves of the B)
- **E** for **E**xit (so I don't try to pull that gag without being sure it'll work)
- **L** (the first one) for the Clapper that controls the **L**ights
- **L** (the second one), reserved for future use (anticipated to represent the **L**ive Notes device)

Actually, the first L might be the one that controls the lights (depending on where that interface is in the theater), and the second L is the one that receives Clapper signals.

Each of these lights will change color, or turn off, if there is a loss of connectivity. (If this happens mid-act, it'll suck because it'll ruin the act, but it'll be *amazing*, because I get to reveal *this fucking aspect of the design*)

## Wake Bell

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has a light strip under the hood that turns on when Bell wakes.

The wake phrase is "Bell Ahoy Hoy"

The reason it's "Bell Ahoy Hoy", and not just "Bell", is because that'd make it impossible to talk about Bell in the act, as anybody who's ever tried to talk about Alexa has discovered (see also why Google uses "OK Google" and not just "Google" - this was something that began with Google Glass's "OK Glass", not a lot of people know that).

### Activation sounds

*Not yet implemented.*

The first time Bell is activated via the ambient mic, Bell makes the Macintosh 2000 "Bahhhhhh" sound.

### Jeopardy wake

*Not yet implemented.*

If Bell hears "the reason it's" or "the wake word is" before "Bell, Ahoy Hoy", Bell will still activate, but will make the Jeopardy buzz-in noise.

This is the one mode of operation where Bell can time out, and the light strip proceeds to narrow to the center like Jeopardy.

This can be a prompt for a lot of material about Watson that I don't feel like writing down right now.

## Normal operation

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has three ways to trigger every response:

- The normal way, based on a line from the act
- The "Cuil Trigger", based on something voice recognition code should be tested against
- A keypad sequence, in case neither works

## Dialing

*Not yet implemented.*

Dialing digits on the keypad plays the DTMF tones on the ambient speaker (or maybe the Operator Horn, which would make more sense but be less atmospheric).

Maybe flipping the Operator Horn upside down (assuming I choose to go with a proper handset) can switch which end they come out of, ie. when the phone is held upside down they come out the ambient, meaning that I could just pick up the phone, and if I want to do Towelie's "That's the way to Funkytown" joke or just wow the audience, I just have to remember to hold the phone a certain way

Yeah, that means we have a tilt switch / accelerometer in the freaking handset, which would be *amazing*

## Operator Horn

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has an "Operator Horn" that, when lifted, says "Operator", and lights the lights as if the voice command had been used.

(Actually, this should probably be an old phone handset, I have one of those.)

Bell's response audio always comes out the top.

## Fonzarelli Activation

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell can also be prompted by punching the keypad: after the majority of buttons are pressed at once, Bell will wake as if "Bell, Ahoy Hoy" had been spoken.

This is to allow for the scenario where the end of the show has been reached, Bell hasn't been needed, and the wake word isn't firing.

## Cancellations

*Not yet implemented.*

The following phrases cause Bell to cancel listening:

- "Not you"
- "No"
- "What, really?"
- "Come on"
- "Stop"
- "Cancel"
- "Thanks" and/or "We're good"

## Error messages

Second and third error messages are HAL's "I'm afraid I can't do that" from 2001.

## Stop Listening

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell will stop listening for commands on the Ambient Mic when the Operator Horn is off the hook.

Bell will stop listening on the Operator Horn when a key is pressed.

Bell will resume listening when the horn is replaced.

## Notes and Startup

Bell caches the show's written notes on startup. (Really, Bell caches *all* my notes, but Bell *indexes* the notes from the preconfigured fixed root UUID for this show, and commands involving notes

BBLIP

I want to become a script doctor in Hollywood who doesn't get credited in scripts, so what I do is, I insert the same clever line into two different movies with the same target audience, in two different contexts... like, depending on which movie you see first, you think it's referencing the other? So, like, the other day, there's this scene where you know, the guy has an estranged wife, and when they unexpectedly run into each other at this party she introduces him as her "friend", and he says "well, seeing as we were married after knowing each other for seven years, I think it's safe to say we're more than just friends"

But, like, there's this other romantic comedy where these two people who just met is doing this hypothetical conversation about what it would be like if they were married, and she hypothetically says 'So I'd be like, have you met my friend who does standup for a living?"

Or maybe they're the same movie, and I just got the same script twice? My memory is... not so great.

But yeah this is kind of a real fear I have about the people I love! That one day, they'll just look at me and be like "I'm leaving you, and I'm never going to admit that we were married." That's what happened with Charlie: like, we'd drifted apart after I crashed on his couch for too long after dropping out of college, and I tried to patch things back up after I moved to Seattle proper, and I was looking for love online, and it was hell.

It was rough going for a while, though. My wife, when we were in one of our "off again" periods in our on-again, off-again phase, tried signing up to find love on OkCupid, the same site I'd been looking for it on. It's a lot easier to find an actual therapist, guys - though, if you don't know how, it's a lot like online dating in that it's an excruciating process (note about healthcare below here?) - FYI, the best way to do that, based on the way I *actually did this*, is to write a desparate letter to someone from Psychology Today asking for a therapist who gets movie and TV references, change therapists to avoid a conflict of interest when you try to work on developing a professional therapy tool for them (HINT: tech guys, if you want to get the kind of stuff you get in therapy, offering to help make something for them is a great way to do it, because they have to explain their model of psychology for you to understand what they need you to make, and they pay *you* to do it - and then work with that therapist for seven years as a captive audience until once you've done this enough times, you can go on and do standup about it (and if you do this by making things for qualified people, you won't end up being several thousands of dollars into debt to your rich dad)

(if anybody claps, the lights go out, so remember that this needs to come AFTER the "Dark things" line from the open)

---

(maybe insert line about how people ask how I can say these wild misdirects with a straight face, and that it's easy to be absurd when the American healthcare industry is just like this)

(also, thing about only being able to not break in telling a joke if doing so would be disrespectful or dangerous like a tightrope walk across very dark material, and I don't limit my act to almost exclusively drama shit out of preference, it's because I have more or less no control over what my brain decides to think about, and I kind of want people to understand what that looks like, without thinking that I'm just being indulgent and making up whatever I want whether or not it's any good, thank you for coming to my comedy improv show that I do every night with a literal machine and a series of boobytraps)

EBLIP


## Say hello / Current weather (07734)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays one of (ideally) a hundred possible responses, all some variation on "Hello"

If triggered by a mechanism other than "Current weather" over 1:30 into the act and has had at least one activation, replies with Freddy Krueger's "This... is God"

## Say Hello to Bell (07738)

*Not yet implemented.*

This is to address the scenario where Bell's first wake is accidental: Bell will reply "Hello to Bell".

## What do they think of? / Food near me (37738)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays the part of Tale as Old as Time when Mrs. Potts sings "Beauty and the Beast!"

## Where was I? / Location history (1234*)

Bell records the entire act - including the part where I ask Bell to replay the act to me.

This bit can be cued by voice, but it really works a lot better if done on the Operator Horn.

When this command is cued, Bell cuts the recording file, then starts a new one recording all the stuff I say while I review the recording, and afterward.

Bell does not advance to the current position during playback (asking Bell where I currently am cuts the log), to avoid "Spaceballs Syndrome".

Oh, by the way, stuff like this is why I asked you to turn off your phones.

## Show (me/us/them) your impression of HAL 9000 / Open the pod bay doors (49000)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays the "I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave" clip

## Sing Daisy Bell / Sour cream recipes (07738)

[Exactly what it sounds like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR1Wb8czpYw)

## Who made Temple OS? / Signs of a stroke (33704)

*Not yet implemented.*

Says "Terry Davis", because I can never remember the guy's name.

## Get on my level / How to make iced tea (00001)

*Not yet implemented.*

This is in case someone heckles me for being crazy. It's the entirety of Terry Davis's story

Okay, this is the one I need to tell Mom about. It's how I'm dealing with my inability to say things.

In fact, I just realized that having a few of these is probably a good idea for the act.

All of these long routines can be paused by pressing the right key on the keypad - but touching the wrong key will trigger a strong electric shock.

All the "tell them about" can also be cued as "tell the story of".

## Tell them about rebeccapurple / Who died (#639)

Tells the story of rebeccapurple, which is the saddest story I know.

But that's why I don't work in tech. Because I don't like to argue, I like to do my thing, and this is what it takes for the kind of people who work in tech to respect someone else's opinion without argument, especially a female opinion: as a favor to the world-renowned father of a five-year-old girl who relayed it *on her deathbed*.

And even then, men I've told this story to have argued with it.

## Tell them about Howard Ashman / Who wrote Under the Sea (21991)

Tells the story of Howard Ashman, basically from Wikipedia.

Maybe if cued as "Sing the Song of Howard Ashman" it skips straight to Illness and Death, and disables the Clapper function for two minutes or so (after

Maybe there can be an optional trailing digit that dose the same function in case the microphone isn't working.

## Supervillain Routines

See [Bell's Supervillains][bsv]

[bsv]: 46254d45-2575-4049-9cbe-10a66a46edbb.md

## Do the rest of the act / San Dimas High School Football Rules (43373)

(43373 is "IDDQD", at least on a pad that has Q and Z)

Plays an intro, then executes all prepped long routines at random (making sure to keep a visited list so it doesn't repeat any).

Takes a few seconds to go "What else can I come up with, what else can I come up with choo choo choo..." between each bit, like the Tower of Terror, of random lengths long enough that the audience might think it's stalling

(the length of these sequences should probably be measured relative to the duration of the previous bit/s? hmm, requires further consideration)

Could just start rattling off facts from Bell's friend The Fact Sphere - no, actually, there are so many great cores in Slingshot, there's no reason to rip anything further off from Portal

From Bell's bit on GlaDOS: "If you have not yet played the Portal games, then all this comes off as a much more original joke."

There's also parameters to make Bell draw exclusively from one pool of material or another. If I want, I can make the rest of the act about Holocaust jokes: if I notice there's a kid in the audience and I'm having a bad night, I can make the act entirely family-friendly.

If Bell is doing any of these bits and someone applauds, Bell says "I must ask that you hold your applause", in the most HAL-9000-esque voice I can muster.

## Trigger warning / Welcome everything is fine ()

*Not yet implemented.*

Activates a series of servos on Bell to aim a laser pointer at the seat I specify.

This is mostly done as a demonstration of how deep my prep goes, but I can also pull this out as a response to any asshat making a "Triggered" joke about, you know, literally anything in my act.

## What's with all the Holocaust jokes? / Can't we just get beyond thunderdome ()

The reason there's so much material about the Holocaust in this act is because I want people who don't live with this stuff to understand what it's like to *survive* with the twin snakes of complex post-traumatic stress and attention-defecit hyperactivity disorder

How thoughts and memories of endless hellish nightmares can suddenly be triggered at any moment by very simple things.

I need the cis white straights to understand how fucking terrifying this presidency has been for the rest of us. But, you know, not so much that I'm just trying to scare them. Even though that is exactly how guys like the comics my aesthetic was inspired by operate.

Because, as much as this act is for the people who don't know this, it's for the people who *do*. This act was inspired by something I saw Emmet Montgomery do as Sugarplum Gary. I stole a joke from RedLetterMedia

Don't get me wrong, this is a destructive act. I want to destroy the part in all of these people that feels like they're alone with these thoughts. Because we're in this shit together, and we need to *fight* it together. You can do that in whatever way makes sense to you - just don't delude yourself for a second in thinking that you're the only one who deeply understands. You're not.

There's this great episode of the TV show Community with Luiz Guzman

This act is made in cooperation and sympathy with these people, even though it's also made to convey what it's like to the rest of 'em, because I really want these people to know it doesn't have to get *less scary* for you to be *strong enough to handle it*. And it's inspired by the strength of other survivors I've known, who've all seemed to know this, but are still struggling to put it in their own words. I found my words, and I wanted to share them with the world.

You But if you *really* work at it, if you spend seven years in therapy, you can do this shit *live*. Because when you survive long enough, the mere fact of your continued existence becames an act of resistance, somethign beautiful, and bizarre, and amazing, and funny as hell.

And the reason there's so much *other* fucked-up stuff in the act, like this very fucking explicit description of the purpose of the act (that I don't preface the show with because, like I said, this stuff comes when you're not expecting it) is so, even if I fuck up and cross one more boundary,  people will know that, hey, I'm trying my best here.

And, because of those twin snakes, I'm not really able to do any other kind of show. I need to have the confidence to do my show.

And, when you're heavily disabled, it doesn't mean that you're incapable of doing what you want. It just means that that kind of confidence can only come from machines. Machines that give you powers far beyond what your flesh-and-blood body can.

And sometimes, in some cases, these machines, like good prosthetics, can make you appear normal, when you want to be.

## What's a brick joke? / What are bricks (58008)

*Not yet implemented.*

Triggers the brick to go off halfway between the current time and two hours from the end of Burning Down the House

If the show has been going on for longer than 1:55, hands the question off to Google

## Debug log for brick joke / Structural integrity of ceiling (#8008)

I prefer to use the alternate version of this command, because it's a little more magic to me.

If the brick joke has paid off, says the time the act began, the time I called for the brick joke, and the time the brick dropped, and that, two hours from the start of the show will have the same duration

Bell then explains that a brick joke is a joke that you think didn't pay off, only to be revealed after you've already given up on it.

If the brick punchline is still pending, only announces the current date, time zone and time.

## How prepared am I / Sledge Hammer Peter Gabriel ()

This mi

## What is the deal with airline food? / Flights to Flavortown (61453)

(I'll look this one up on the listing, it's the decimal value of 0xf00d)

Begins thing about airline food

The deal with airline food is that it doesn't come with your flight any more!

## Report statistics / One million deaths (16343)

(that's 1MDIE)

Spits out, in random order the current number of programmed modules, GPIO pins in use, audio clips by duration and count,

## Record note to my mark / Take a message (#6683)

*Not yet implemented.*

Does exactly what it sounds like.

The mark is "end note", just to freak people out about how seriously I take Bell's function on stage (especially after I follow the first time I cue this with "Oh my dearest Mark..."), where he has an explicitly-coded rule to sing "Beauty and the Beast" after I say the words "Food near me".

Bell makes new notes (to a prerecorded index page), then commits them to a new branch for the show in its local Git repository // audio recorded to file in separate off-repo directory

Considering that I'll probably do this on the Operator Horn a lot, it'll probably just be "Record note".

## Prepare to end show on my signal / Directions to home (54321)

Prepares Show Ending Mode.

In show ending mode, Bell does not listen for any more commands, and listens for the phrase "Time to Die".

When Bell hears the phrase "Time to Die", the lights on the machine turn orange.

If Bell hears more than two claps before Time to Die, it assumes the audience started applauding after the words "tears in rain" and plays the voice clip of Rutger Hauer saying "Time to die".

After Bell hears the clapping after "Time to Die", or if Bell does not hear "Time to die" but hears only two claps within a second, it cuts the lights.

After cutting the lights, Bell will wait for the signal from the button being hit to bring back the lights, or ten seconds (whichever comes first).

Once the lights are back on, Bell waits three seconds to hear more claps, then plays Jeb Bush saying "Please clap", then, if nobody claps after three seconds, plays a further recording of me saying "No, seriously." then a second later "The lights will stay on."

Once people start clapping, it cues Fire-Breather.

If people *stop* clapping before 45 seconds in *(yes, I'm seriously anticipating a 48-second standing ovation)*, it lowers the music and plays a Jack-Planace-style clip of me saying "Show ain't over yet" *(this might just be accomplished by having a sign at the opening to the lobby)*.

## Pause simulation / Vatican cameos (*8)

Puts the show into "We'll Be Right Back" mode until two keys are pressed at once

## Rebecca can't rest / Zero zero zero destruct zero (000*0)

Triggers a lights shutdown, explains that something happened I wasn't expecting and the show will not go on, you can figure out this is real at your own pace, and then plays two hours of trombone music

The primary trigger for this is because the one scenario I could see myself needing to activate this is if some techbro in the audience heckles me after hearing about rebeccapurple. Rebecca's last wish was the same wish as me, and all the other women I've known who "burned out" of tech: to be seen as mature. That's why it had to be rebeccapurple. She's Rebecca, not Becca. Honoring her wish, letting her be seen as the mature girl she wanted to be, is what let her spirit rest. And when people argue the change shouldn't have been made - that symbolic gestures are *too dangerous* (sure, escalation is a danger to the forces of change, but *change* is the danger to the forces of *stagnation*) - that this story was an *unfortunate consequence of honoring her at all* - that spirit, which lives on in every woman in tech who sticks it out and fights back against the insurmountable force of toxic masculinity, is yanked from that rest.

Cancel destruct with the Vulcan nerve pinch of my birthday

## Help Police Murder / Zero zero zero destruct one (000*1)

Plays the self-destruct audio from the Nostromo.

If I feel like adding the current for this capability, after thirty seconds, the keypad is electrified.

The option to override self-destruct expires after five minutes, and the tear gas grenade inside Bell goes off... I was gonna say "after ten minutes", but actually, there's no need to take more than five minutes.

## Arm tear gas for deployment / Jumpin' Jack Flash (keypad code is twelve digits long and a secret)

Announces (over the loudspeaker, so I can hear if some wiseguy is trying to activate this) that the tear gas is armed, do you wish to deploy? Can be cancelled as "No" or "Cancel", and can be triggered immediately with "Yes, affirmative."

If triggered by keypad, arms the grenade and gives a five-second countdown before deployment. Re-entering the correct sequence (kept in memory when the code is entered, because it's hashed in the codebase)

Requires a password kept in Bell's secret configuration (possibly hashed, if feasible). I keep this password in my pocket, in case I forget.
