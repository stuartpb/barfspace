# Messays

Mediations and Musings, in long form and shorthand quips

This is a lot of mixed-up content with a lot of legacies. (See [this page][Musings] for an oral history of how some of the original Messays were kept before this collective repo.)

[Musings]: pem16-afvwm-r6bwf-2tgdp-52ng7

Now it's just a collection of pages with more clarity in their theme:

- [The Spiral Mountain of Design and Social Psychology](8p7rm-5qj6z-we8w5-t78g4-7698p) captures the spirit of the "original musings"
- [Worse Is Better](hp3rj-bp2vq-059k3-ge144-a3tcv) collects another similar and adjacent theme
  - [This subpage](6yanh-hg3gd-s69sp-wyba4-qgkgt) that's an intersection between those writings and [the Academy](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j), which is also sort of a Messays hub
- [Right, Secure, Robust, and Strong](9qb42-94e42-81ans-2rerv-1nq45) collects some security writing that can wax messay
- [Smuggler's Cove](b39ge-ag6e2-y39vc-qwm8a-cmwmy) is similarly a theme page that might start to collect thoughts
- [The Messay Spoon](fyj7f-zw3kv-wzat9-pt901-1z8r9), a [tavern][] for messays that don't fit into an existing hub yet
  - [Big Titles](w3y50-zq5xh-wh97v-mv9nd-xmdg6) lists Groups looking for Pages
- the [Raw page](ma0yx-s2yc4-0688t-j0zvb-x73es), where I only write because it hurts

[tavern]: tk9fv-fjcxb-g0amm-wgchp-ktmw6

Complex Messays can lead into [Methods](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma) and vice versa

## The Format

Each md file should be about the size of a GitHub issue comment, one that'd be appropriate posted in many issues, and at the same time appropriate in none. They should stand alone, [like a dandelion seed forever drifting on the wind, by which we may know the universe][seed].
