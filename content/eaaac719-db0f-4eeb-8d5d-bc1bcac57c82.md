# Archaeology Force

This is the counterpart to the Academy's [Notegraph Historium](c4ab1f6b-cac2-4025-ae27-3b82f0a9d4c6.md), under the juristiction of [the Department](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md),that originally gathered at [how-i-roll's Tomb](bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md)

Its job is to find historic notes and move them into pages under the Historium

It produced an onboarding unit with Operation Trapper Keeper for integrating my old OneNote notes: the [Deep Note Divers](acea3fb8-4b0d-434e-aefd-3a75ced4f0a2.md)

There's also the [planfile historical content expedition](aa9294c4-dabd-4638-a2db-5bbeb6236f8e.md) to produce pages for content that was removed from stuartpb.plan
