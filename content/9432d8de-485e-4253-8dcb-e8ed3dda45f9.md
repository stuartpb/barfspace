(a divergence on top-notes and sprout as a UI feature in a proper web editor was moved to the notes page for [borkflowy][])

blip thought (originally in the middle of the sprout-menu/top-links digression):

  - [thoughts on a style guide and best practices](70fa4c0d-914b-4e59-9a26-e1b3c99573e6.md)
    - [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md), if there isn't already a page about it (History Force? Understanding Lua's meta notes?)
    - This should maybe be looped in with The Organic Junction so they can inform each other
  - [extending and enhancing the basic bagtent model](539e354a-b20e-4ea3-9bdc-14cddac5cd76.md)
  - [notes on mixing content types](b2dade14-8a6c-4643-9fdb-2fc6b441016c.md) (kind of interplays with "extending")
  - [thoughts on "aliases" for short, fixed page names](6dfcd6df-31e9-46bb-9b75-d750a5456de8.md)
