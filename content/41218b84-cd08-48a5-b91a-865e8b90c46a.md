# Right Now for Stuart P. Bentley

Here's a nexus for a bunch of corners of the notes that might give you an idea of what I've been working on and how I've been doing:

There's [this page about Getting My Shit Together][GYST] that is currently sort of like my "cursor" for remembering what I'm planning / in the middle of or whatever on "maintenance" of these notes. Like a build journal or something, idk, it kind of happened organically.

[GYST]: 1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md

The [Quests][] index is kind of like a spread-out to-do notebook, though some of these "quests" have been abandoned for years. (Some might have become entirely irrelevant.)

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md

The [self-improvement and wellness index][Self] covers what I'm getting up to personally and habitually.

[Self]: 2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md

The [checkin list][checkins] has some pages where I'll sometimes just go off about things I'm feeling with how my life is at - these are probably the most clearly dated posts here (though the Get Your Shit Together page is getting addendums like that).

[checkins]: afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md

My status on a bunch of [projects][] has a page, kind of: these might get separated into "current notes" and "standing notes" at some point, I don't know. It's never really been easy to separate the two notions, and everything temporal tends to be connected, so it probably finds its way into Checkins above.

[projects]: 8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md

There's also a new page for [Learning Journeys][], which is kind of like for experimentation in a pre-project phase (which is admittedly rare for me, as I usually learn by choosing a project to pursue pretty quickly).

[Learning Journeys]: 9403033b-a238-47d1-865b-4e1baa0f2577.md

There's also a page on [what I'm wearing these days][Loadout].

[Loadout]: d9cb40c4-b0c0-49c4-94cc-5033dd9316f7.md
