# alternative pointing devices for the pocketchip

eh, just throw a bluetooth mouse in your bag.

what'd be cool would be a USB-C trackball, with a USB-C hub built into the case... this is all a pipe dream, though

but, like, what if the [integrated stylus](4e6xh-q9xpq-fz8ns-qypk7-sakgg) could also be used as a Wiimote, or laser pointer?

that'd be a convenient way to have right clicks, actually

anyway, the logical wireless for this is Bluetooth, and that's not  something I can readily find.

The parts required to make this an actual integrated peripheral seem more complicated than just using a stylus-ready screen like a Wacom...

hmm, idk though? like, I don't think the Wacom pen has range outside of the scrren, and I was thinking like it'd be cool for the integrated peripheral

and, like, yeah the pressure screen could fake Wacom features with an integrated gyro to compare it against

some things seem like it might be simpler to do this as a 2.4GHz periheral?

anyway this is sounding more and more like a HAT, ie. to add the onboard gyro (leading into [Pi successor brainstorming](twqef-9vakr-0baj7-xym4h-4kbm7))

# anyway, pointing

what if the top of the stylus had a little teeny trackball

and, like, you could use that for rotating a 3D view, while you rotate the pen to turn the model (or vice versa)

omg what if this beamed out a little mini-Lighthouse signal to get Leap Motion like 6DOF responsiveness

or actually used some kind of leapmotion sensor idk? thinking about range

what about a Razer Hydra like system?

anyway, this is starting to turn into a useful phone peripheral for VR like Daydream,  rather than a poor underpowered PocketC.H.I.P thing

that's another idae, though: open daydream remote design
