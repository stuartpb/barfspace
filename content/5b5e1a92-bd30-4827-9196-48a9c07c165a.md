# Pull requests for barfspace

Just don't be a dick and issue a pull request for something I clearly care about and have put a lot of thought into that would change it to your conflicting worldview.

Other than that, hell yeah dude, shoot your shot, offer to clean up any of this mess, God knows it needs it.

Oh, also, one other thing: **by contributing content to this repository, you relinquish all copyright on that content and release it into the public domain**, including any sort of claims toward requiring attribution (though I'll probably include your authorship metadata in the Git history, mostly since it'd just be more work to remove it). That's the important thing I was thinking I should make this file to state - as much as I like collectivizing everything and all, *this* repo doesn't really have a focus beyond "stuff Stuart P. Bentley typed", so unlike pretty much any other project I do, I'm not really looking to make it a collective project with many authors.
