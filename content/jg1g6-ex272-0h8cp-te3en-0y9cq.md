# Learning Journeys

Notes I make as I explore various technologies.

## This vs. Lean Notes

The branches here tend to be sort of hyperfocus-oriented rather than task oriented - more about getting a mastery of the subject matter

I think there ought to be a place for both, though: Lean Notes takes you towards which subjects you need, and this branch (Deep Notes?) takes you into, like, the most comprehensive overview of the details that you ought to consider if you're doing something novel at any point

This is what I think of as an "index", in the conventional "thing at the end of the book that gathers all the pages that cover a shared topic" sense

more, older reflections / thoughts on this relationship between the branches [over here](8gj2n-jfyqa-cwaby-402r1-5a4g7)

## Refactoring

This should really be reworked as "Discovery Journals", to distinguish it from Journals of Implementation or Considered Takes

These collect the scattered notes from when I'm first discovering a new topic, as I surveil its shape and floorplan

## Software-type study

These are all studies of protocols, libraries, interfaces, techniques, things like that

Much like the different categories of Project, they're not mutually exclusive, but usually point to adjacent categories instead of sharing links

## Other kinds of note

[Data and Reference Sheets](70hgj-ev4td-0rap9-m57mw-h4fcg) tracks various pieces of information that I've collected (or found).

[Maker Journeys](sp25c-yjwq5-088bc-5zwec-p0sat) explores more "hard" technology (like plastic and steel).
