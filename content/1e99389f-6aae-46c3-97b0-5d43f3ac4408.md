# a fleet of encrypted MicroSD cards

this is the Shadow Curtain concept I'm currently looking at: keeping a bunch of MicroSD cards in a little thing attached to my phone, some of which sync to encrypted data on the pwnagotchi

these could all, like Ceph, use some kind of partition identifier that identifies them as an encrypted volume, so they automatically prompt to unlock when inserted

- secrets
  - for passwords, password hints, things like that
- shadow
  - for personal thoughts when I'm in an unpleasant way
  - other possible names: darkdiary
- intel
  - for dossiers, Circus Rosa, BIGDOG stuff

These could also maybe be kept in different trinkets: one in a locket, one in a secret panel of a table, one in a ring (maybe always in a USB reader, like a drive) etc.

In fact, the "data ring" approach is a pretty sweet idea
