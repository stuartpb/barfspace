# Timeframe Tickets

Maybe it's the screenwriter in me, but I was thinking about ways to make it so a file would forcibly expire by not being able to be decrypted

The sci-fi concept is that it's somehow encrypted against a future state of the universe, which can't be reproduced because that information is lost from instant to instant

so the Quadration version would probably be having the key need to be decrypted by a trusted third-party before it wipes all memory of the key
