[Understanding Talos Better](82bbe05b-3725-4105-aaa1-ee09497ade40.md) illuminates another use for a small few-job Raspberry Pi: providing the preflashed IPX images to set up new nodes

there's also the whole section on How the Face Should Work: this'd be a sensible function for the "Head" of the KubePet

the "face" could also show, like, "writing, please do not reconfigure the storage pool..."

## Oh, okay

From https://blog.alexellis.io/test-drive-k3s-on-raspberry-pi/

> The Raspberry Pi Zero and first-gen RPi (armv6l) are not compatible with k3s. The main reason is that these devices have very low-powered and so the Kubernetes project does not publish Docker images for this CPU architecture.

however, this could still be used to launch a pod by iPXE booting a rump kernel or whatever on a fixed core
