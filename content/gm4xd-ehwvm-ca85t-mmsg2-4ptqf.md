# Project Idea Incubator

This is *far* from a comprehensive list of all my project ideas: *that* list is up on https://unusual.studio/projects.

(Note that there's a note about merging that into this, though)

However, sometimes that page needs a place to reference project ideas, and sometimes, those project ideas live in these notes. (At some point, these notes will probably get a special kind of link there, like what I think "Info" currently has.)

It's important to note that the UUIDs used *here* have no relation to the UUIDs used elsewhere (ie. for reference in Unusual Studio) - a UUID refers either to a project listing there, or a document here. Any project that's listed both here *and* there is going to have two separate UUIDs, [and that's the way it should be](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/8).

Here are some pages that collect recurring classes or "themes" of projects I get ideas for or an interest in (for comparing and contrasting the ideas) - they're not exclusive, but all the projects in these notes should be linked off at least one of them:

[Hall of Champions Needed](t0qv3-yszzz-40a4v-5zgbk-f43j6) should build off of this?

## Software ideas

or "Softworks", to brainstorm page names as this splits out

Most of these are, of course, framed around the kind of software stack I detail in Zero to Software: open source, preferably with a backing non-profit foundation, and Web-stack compatible as much as possible.

## Elsewhere

- [Loose Project ideas and pointers](dk9ad-w713a-aaazs-fggrh-9e3g2)

## Software

- A bunch of projects are joining together in one conceptual crossover:
  - [Super Space Bros Melee](2x4aj-0v68q-bras8-a6c1f-wk103)
  - Going forward, this will vacuum links out of the next few categories, probably
- [Collective Content Containers](78wkm-ztrw0-fyaxy-96fcq-s27wn)
  - ie. ideas for forums and wikis using non-conventional post/article formats
- [Content Editor Ideas](aamhr-wg63b-cf806-5kx1h-n3g6n), stuff like IDEs
- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](ty5xn-fv406-4ya51-2hrm0-84st8)
- [Components, Features, and Parts](sgm3d-n5d7z-ra8jx-4r3y6-cd6rp)
- [Command-Line Utilities](200f9-jdwgd-he8ef-nbkhy-6thjf)
- [Infrastructure Projects](qf8xs-a6nk5-g18y2-5drdy-rmxrc)
- [Spec ideas](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t)
- [Browser Extensions](aqwqk-rbhx4-6vanm-hm867-cfewx)
- [Virtual Reality](5c4np-ytghb-40a9a-40624-3012q)
  - naturally some of this is hardware-oriented too, it's listed twice
  - This section is getting big enough to split to its own page, like software in Journals
  - A few other pages below should probably also have their own roots tying them together
- [Non-Web-Platform Software Projects](9c41h-p8rmf-2d8gh-f514q-yj7cj)
  - Complemented by [this reframing of everything on this page in web-stack terms](v4zpd-ca2ft-cr8nh-rmzd2-jqyrp)

## TODO: weave this in

[Lash Revisited](jbb6w-e5s60-4gar1-53g3b-kwf0g)

## A different dimension

- [Security node](9qb42-94e42-81ans-2rerv-1nq45) should start collecting security-adjacent projects
- [Smuggler's Cove](b39ge-ag6e2-y39vc-qwm8a-cmwmy) is right next door to that

## More-physical projects

These still often involve a lot of code-type-stuff

- [Maker projects](p9mme-p7s37-c6a56-vvqwc-9xatr)
  - [An Open Basis for Everything](rey3y-7md66-csaqb-af2wj-yrt0f)\
- [Microcontrollers](w35ys-awamc-8pavt-p66fh-y2z8r)
  - [NodeMCU ESP{8266,32} Projects](qt7f4-7zadv-wp8q1-wtahm-mzcmz)
- [Robotics](9s0en-bqhj7-25a3d-xw20h-f1rgg)
  - [Drone project stuff](snrsq-r2vfg-m3ask-yfdke-v58cb)
  - [Hands work](nrj3m-eesg0-m897x-rs36q-n36t6)

Similarly, there are local endeavors that take on the characteristics of a "project":

- [Quests Around the House](8hded-p2qjr-yq8cj-3g9j7-bq7gr)
- [Junkyard Daydreams](6eyb4-2tx40-q58xe-gnagc-85s4a)

## Other creative project like stuff

- [game projects](8ym4p-vxrb0-449ar-r04c5-b9gg5)
- [Big Titles](w3y50-zq5xh-wh97v-mv9nd-xmdg6), a kind of incubator for [messay](hwhnk-bgrdy-4rbbs-9kyf0-qfsrw) clusters
- [Pitches and Scripts](pabtd-y2p8v-819qr-eqxng-5d98k)

## Other speculative dens of creation or whatever

- [Community Wishlist](sfwb4-37xeb-42aag-wn5r2-6s2av), for organizations I wish existed
- [Collaborative Content Collections](za4n5-bv4hz-8xa39-ssp19-14e8h)
- [Spec ideas](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t)
- [Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma), for "projects" that are just "coming up with ways to do things"

## And finally

- [Odd Project Ideas](sfmjh-p9khm-0ca3g-tw3at-q0jxn), the tavern-page for projects that don't fit prominently into the above

## Very Special Projects

- [stuartpb.com root server notes](05aaz-77jps-aeadb-cqxg8-z2yan)
- [Unusual Studio](4598s-yrtrd-188dq-w6qdv-hajj3)
- [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3)

## Other project-related pages

the [Notestack Core](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) is the node in these notes where projects tend to form.

There's [this stub for a Tech Tree](00rj1-384jf-ef9tw-3dqwe-tn98c) (previously known as Toolchained Melody) that might be another page to explore some kind of structure wherein projects here can enable other projects.

For other context that *might* explain some of these, see [Right Now][] and [News][].
