# Annoyances and Papercuts

This is a page for aggregating various software issues I've found but not reported, and other things in my life that bother me (mostly in a desktop/mobile sense, but that scope might expand - we'll see how this continues).

As they say, necessity is the mother of invention: some of these might evolve into full-featured projects to fix the issues they identify. Others will probably just lead to a simple pull request.

Single-system issues (ie. "I broke X"), which tend to be more forensic in nature than inventive, will be found listed on pages for their corresponding [pet systems][].

## Volume Level Normalization

How do you watch those movies wheree the wuiet part is too quiet and the loud part is too loud? Can they be curved? How can I do this in MPV? Can I have a UI for it?
