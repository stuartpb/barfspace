# Undesign

An exploration of Emergent Behaviors, Fractal Restrictions, and Discoverability

*or*

How Tools Control the Way We Use Them, How the Tools We Use Shape Our Thoughts, and How Not All Features Are Features

## Pitch

This is another topic (or collection of topics) I feel like I have a lot to write about: how communities form around features and bugs, how features get picked up without the users having to be told about them, stuff like that. If *[Nerd First][]* is my version of *The Tipping Point* or *The Black Swan*, *Undesign* would be my *Blink* or *Antifragile*. (Actually, I should probably read *Antifragile*, especially considering how often I talk about it.)

### Progress

*Undesign* is unwritten. What's in this file is the extent of the pre-existing content I'd put toward this theme thus far. There was a repository for it, but all it had was 4 commits working on that tagline, plus an issue noting that I could pull examples from http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AscendedGlitch.
