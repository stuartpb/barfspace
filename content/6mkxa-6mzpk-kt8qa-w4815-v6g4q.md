# Form vs Button design

when looking at Kubeapps upgrade forms in [Following the Rebuilding Plan](5mj23-sjeyj-jqana-5xdyg-fg6gd)

Something like this has better UX if you think of it as "Drafting a form that you're going to submit" - like, the best UX would keep drafts, and let you compare them and all that (a UI for submitting a Pull Request to apply an Upgrade? is that a Flux thing?) - but, like, you want to be (un)checking boxes, not toggling switches. You're not submitting anything yet.

If your thing takes place immediately, make it a switch or a slider. If it's a draft form, use checkboxes and tickers.
