# plans for bagtent itself

This is going to be my little scratchpad for initial ~~thoughts~~ plans on bagtent itself for a moment

actually this is just for plans, [this page][using] is for reflections, and together *these* are the "thoughts"

bagtent should have a web ui

I'm also thinking, like, have it be something that can work like workflowy? like, every time there's a list and a link, do the search thing, and have "create (literal symbol)" as an option at the end to create a new page, which is inline-inserted

maybe have an extension that lets you open a new document (with a link to the current page or whatever) and works like the bagtent-sprout script, in that you have to pick a document to add it to (from a dropdown that sorts by pages with most inter-content links)

that can actually be a feature in the post script, it looks up which files have the most outbound links and suggests them for addition first

similarly, that can be the main heuristic (or, rather, default sort heuristic, or maybe just a tiebreaker)

each menu takes either a search string, a number, or maybe a colon-prefixed line that's a command like `:sort inbound:ascending,match` to make longest-match only the tiebreaker sort for pages with the fewest inbound links (or you could even sort outbound first)

maybe that should be how the line works by default, there's number prompts, letter commands, and then like vi/less, you can type `/` or `:` or `-` or `+` to do searches, commands, or param settings (respectively). maybe also have something like a backtick for prefix-split (ie. the default for non-alias) and  `~` for fuzzy searches? and maybe `'` for literal search (closing single quote is optional and is treated like closing brace in `test`, where it ignores only the last one if present)?

how do I inject a suggested character to the read buffer? do I just have to listen for backspace and fake having a character in the buffer before the actual start of the line?

I'm thinking all configuration can be by environment variables, `BAGTENT_DEFAULT_FIRSTLINK_SORT` or stuff like something like that

I can also use `bagtent` to demonstrate how an ideal version of git's "[did you mean][]" would work

another thing I'd like to add is a script that adds / allows for a metadata file listing content files that don't accept new internal links, eg. for deprecating a page

could also allow for some kind of ACL structure, where all commits from "owners" of various files are auto-merged (so long as they're appropriately rebased)

ownership and selections like that can recursively delegate by link (in a second system that maybe compiles into a raw UUID list, or maybe it's a directory of "maintainers" or "owners" by username/owner name, or owners themselves have UUIDs - actually, let's say the user system would work by directories, where the user directory names can be whatever you want), but you probably want that to be filtered by stuff like "child that only has parents/inbounds under this root" or "isn't owned by one of these / any users"

exclusive ownership can also be handled by some higher-level thing that can reject multiple ownership by checking some extended constructs

maybe that directory can be "authors"

you can have authors updated by some kind of CI or tooling or whatever from content (or vice versa), but that's your own thing to figure out (in that case, you can make your authors by UUID of the file that defines them)

there's also of course aliases (maybe that'd be the default namespace for non-numeric or prefixed lines - and aliases that are numbers get populated as default options, if they're within the range of the list)

part of me feels like aliases should be called refs, but, nah, refs are namespaced, aliases live in one namespace (though I guess that namespace allows directory separators)

I recommend having a restriction against any two data types (content, authors, assets, etc) share a UUID if one isn't directly defined by the other (though things like a scheme where there's a subdirectory of assets as attachments to content, it's OK to structure those by UUID of the content they're attached to, as that's not a structure the way "an asset" is)
