# The "I'll Just Put This Here" Effect

It's incredible how efficient *just keeping a link to something in a prominent place* can be, at least for me.

It's a little frustrating to see people repeatedly say and do the same stuff without building on what came before, and I feel like that's because we're always looking for *new* content and not sharing similar thoughts when they come up, I don't know.

Basically, I'd love to see a society structured around sharing prior art, y'know? I know that's certainly one of the things that's helped *just for me personally*, being able to re-reference old ideas I had for what might have been worthwhile within them, stuff like that.

This also ties into the larger [humans-not-needing-much-structure][structurelessness] observation / effect.
