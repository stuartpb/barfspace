# My Canon

I like my bible, which contains deeply spiritual, clever jokes, a bit of enlightening wisdom, and *so* much fucking swearing

This page needs to be merged with the one that listed the influences on The Unconvincing Truth

## Movies

The Room is a *very* holy movie, *especially* with the way Tommy handled it after people started laughing.

Similarly, Rocky Horror is canon.

The Producers, both versions, are canonical, because the actors of both versions are too good to cut out, and the original is the only one with the character of LSD, who is admittedly dated to anybody whose religion didn't start in the Sixties, and the musical made the right call in cutting his character and changing the gag with why Springtime for Hitler is a success

Most of Mel Brooks' movies are in the canon, actually. And Mel Brooks is a Probationary Sinner Second Class

Flaming Carrot is one of those higher-caste fictional saints that I haven't learned the ranks of yet.

Coco

Stop Making Sense

Dr. Strangelove

Groundhog Day (as remakes go, Edge of Tomorrow is a *good* movie - even arguably better than the original - but it's too neat, too Aneristic, not open-endedly canon the way Groundhog Day is)

Moneyball (honestly, an embarassing amount of Aaron Sorkin's stuff is canon)

A Kid in King Arthur's Court

the Richie Rich movie from the Nineties was good, and had a great gag about secret messages in Latin, but I haven't watched it recently enough to know if it's canon (I remember it being about as good as A Series of Unfortunate Events, but then, I was like seven, I would have thought Reagan was cool)

the Back to the Future trilogy (because, come on, I wore a hat advertising a fansite for it for like six years, it *has* to be), more the first one than the subsequent pair o' Docs

the original Star Wars Trilogy (what, you think I'm too cool to admit I've seen Star Wars?)

Resurrect Dead

## TV Shows

Mystery Science Theater 3000

Black Mirror (and Bandersnatch)

The Good Place

Freakazoid!

Arrested Development (including the Netflix seasons)

On questions on canonicity of various episodes of The Simpsons, I defer to the scholarship of the [Dead Homer Society][DHS] (with the caveat that I think they're wrong about the masterpiece that gave us "THRILLHO" being One Bad Episode).

Baccano! is like the most Discordian anime in history

- Spacewar (the First Game)
- The Stanley Parable
- The Penis Game (which is just when you're in a horrible oppressive place like church or school and see who can yell "PENIS" in the loudest voice without getting in trouble)

## Books and Graphic Novels

- [Three Men in a Boat][] (to say nothing of the Dog!)
  - To give you an idea of how genius this fucking book is, it's *well* over a hundred years old, I read it somewhere around 2002, and I'm *still* not convinced it wasn't written in at *least* the nineteen-fifties. Like Lemony, it reads like a parody of Charles Dickens, and, man, the dude who wrote it *was not even trying*.
- Finnegans Wake
- This Book Will Change Your Life (and it did!)
- Understanding Comics
- All-Star Superman
- V for Vendetta (most of Alan Moore's stuff is good, but it's a little too dark to make it into the Bellarian canon: V is all right, though)
- Sandman is **not** canon. Last time I checked, Neil Gaiman is too pretentious to be a Bellarian, though that was during my Dark Time, in which not only did I not Get the Joke, but I Thought I Got It, so it's entirely possible I misjudged him. Also, I judge works based on their endings, and I got kicked off the couch I was crashing on before I got to the end of the series.
- Bone
- Scud the Disposable Assassin
- the entire Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes Bomb Manual is canon - the more coffee you spill on it, the more canonical it gets, like in one of the best gags of Schindler's List.
- A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (not that I've read it)
- The Eye, the Ear, and the Arm
- [Wigfield][] (which was an influence on the idea of giving Barfspace a [Visitor Center][])

I haven't read VALIS, but it's definitely a *strong* predecessor to BELL

I feel like every incomplete book that was ever posthumously compiled from a deceased author's notes should be regarded as canon:

- The Silmarillion
- The Salmon of Doubt

What about House of Leaves?

The Order side of Bellarianism has some books, too, though I don't think I've read them:

- [A New Kind of Science](https://www.wolframscience.com/nks/)
- Cheaper by the Dozen and Belles on their Toes

## Podcasts and Radio

- The Unbelievable Truth

## Sketches

- [The Treaty of Westphalia][]

## Websites, Ebooks, Articles, and Textfiles

The Jargon File is **foundationally** Discordian, possibly even more than the Principia. Eric S. Raymond's version is the most easily understood, but not necessarily the canonical copy.

The Cluetrain Manifesto

[SPACEWAR: Fanatic Life and Symbolic Death Among the Computer Bums, by Stewart Brand](http://stuartpb.github.io/spacewar-article/spacewar.html) is so canonical, I made my own transcription of it.

The canonicity of The Anarchist's Cookbook is still under debate. Top Bellarian scholars are still unsure whether or not to recognize its authority.

That one letter that guy sent Senator John Kerry that ends, at least in [the Something Awful reading](https://www.somethingawful.com/flash-tub/letter-from-internet-3/), "I would love to get in Star Trek battles". Have we not all reached out to an unexpected savior at times in our lives with a great, outlandish plea? (If not, you might want to consider trying Religion, it makes life a lot more fun. Have you maybe heard about Discordianism?)
