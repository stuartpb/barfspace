# Makes from Online

Here's a page collecting stuff that I've printed etc. but not otherwise developed myself.

They may bust out to more elaborate pages documenting my own modifications at some point.

- [The Turbine grinder][] and the funnel and funnel-packer from [gruppler's Pax 2 Tools][] (all they need is a place to put the lid and they'd be perfect)
- [Black Ram Hand Mark VII][] (I've got some ideas about how I'd like to improve this mechanically)
- [this Smart Wallet by b03tz][b03tz] (I didn't need to do any gluing, which was lucky because Tiare took my one remaining good bottle of super glue)
  - UPDATE: after dropping the wallet and having it come parat a few times, I am gluing this wallet
