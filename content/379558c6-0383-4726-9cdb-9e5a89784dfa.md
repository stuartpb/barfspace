## Also

- [How I'm Writing With Bagtent](13ceb37e-99d5-417b-be3c-ec7e1bc537ac.md) covers a lot of Oozy Sewer thoughts, and should really be worked out between here and the Academy
  - It includes a bit on how bagtent reflects my mind's structure as also described below

## Indexes of Classes of Development with Examples

- [Note Compilation Albums Index](47a373bd-bf1b-4610-83ca-9da697aba0c0.md)

  - even as this gets broken out, whatever's left at this hub will definitely be of interest to the Oozy Sewer

## How these notes become more

- [the ooze](5db9131a-c60c-4b32-8aa1-5790fb3ef25e.md)
  - talks about how these notes are like proto-code
- [Recursively Knowing What's To Be Done](679a0f00-722b-443a-acb6-83dbe022a3d0.md)
  - touches on the same idea but maybe a little more clearly stated
- [an artifact desiring this page early in development](a493d478-8002-4328-8608-42d09ca38616.md)
  - previously found on [Project Akira](dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md)

## To integrate

- [this page on lifecycles](b5f6a776-5e6f-4386-999a-d4c9c196f67b.md)
  - which was about unrelated pages mutating after falling out of regular familiarization
  - which interacts with the redundancy of trees as focus drifts
    - and how sometimes things falling out and becoming fossils is the right way to move on
    - and how those fossils can become fuel for new content in [pivoting](3f5173cb-34c3-4077-89b2-637624eca32d.md)
    - this also touches on "Boxcar Children" as described below
- [this Right Now in The Notes page](9d2999b6-8d6d-417b-9a60-36df93a05192.md)
  - mostly being a lot of frenzied rambling
  - has some ideas that should be cut and moved to here:
    - a huge thing about how pathways also have lifecycles
    - the "refactoring by replacement" style where a blueprint for a page's rework goes on the page, then gradually becomes the basis for the page's new content (ie. triage technique)
      - In conjunction with the "general listification" technique described below, "Triage Techniques" should probably be a section on this page
  - The page itself should be reworked as a historical note of all these refactors that cropped up at once
- [mutation frenzy](03bf0054-bd27-4869-a60d-53de5ad2c2c5.md) is a sort of redundant accompaniment to that page that should be similarly reconciled
- [Content As Its Own Identifier](cc4c4ee9-9b10-4ef2-853a-4c2278c4952b.md)

## loose observation of a new technique I'm doing, flow-wise

if I go off on a tangent that I'm not sure how to merge / extricate from a page, I go back to where the page is listed and note other things that are on the page as text

(for example, here and now, I've got list items elaborating on content underneath the pages in the "To integrate" list above)

this text can then be reformatted as a link when the page is created - or deleted / moved to a more relevant place

the place that originated the tangent ought to provide a link to it when the tangent moves to its own page, for places where the description leading into the link was only contextual, and needs to be worked into its own link

- "general listification" (where a description of an idea is restructured into a semantic tree by converting to bullet points in an ul) is a Good Pattern that should be documented
  - hence why OneNote was so into it and Workflowy uses it so much
  - of course, it's not the basic narrative structure that forms a note's document root, but that's not a bad thing
  - I should start a note collecting this way that the notes reflect the structure of my mind
  - This came from list items that worked their links in inline
    - I'm moving away from footlinks, and letting the addresses go inline at the end helps avoid text get visually "lost" after the link
  - It also makes text easier to read than long wrapping paragraphs

## pulled off line

pulled off from the area right around the tree that now lives [here](9051d114-d326-43b8-a51d-e4eefce29e10.md):

> EDITOR'S NOTE: I think this list might be too deeply nested to work with some Markdown rulesets - should really get its own page tree

basically, if your list is eight spaces deep, it might start to get detected as a code block, and that's a sign it should be split up into more pages

## another concept

"Boxcar Children" could be what I call pages that all link to each other, where a "parent" can emerge later by just collecting the union of all these similar groups of links, and then they can be replaced by that parent node if the links not covered in the page's own list are not noise too much

And if they are, it'll just keep the redundant list

## heuristic

- a page should split once it's not easy to remember where any particular clause would be found in a couple seconds of scrolling on it.
  - Alternately, when you'd want to have multiple carets to keep your place with text you're inserting into one section, because you don't want to lose the position you were previously inserting to to look for or insert text in another part of the piece, it's probably time to have these passages living in different buffers that have all that kind of metadata separate.
  - "Different buffers" is probably the easiest way to describe how I work this heuristic mentally, actually.
  - This also applies to how I generally factor my writing structures, really, code and prose, not just in barfspace (though especially in barfspace).

## thematic things

- desire paths
