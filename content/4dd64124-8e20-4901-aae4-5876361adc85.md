## Writing stuff

Where I put all the stuff I've been wanting to say about security and auth systems design for years, but have been to scared to say (because it's mostly just co-opting the tone of everybody else who writes in the infosec space, with zero practical/firsthand experience or evidence to back it up).

Note that these files were never actually comitted to the stuartpb on Security repo, and as such may actually be incomplete in their currently comitted form (in fact, I'm sure that at least two of these have at least one incomplete sentence each):

- [Verif Morghulis: All Passwords Must Die](0d21bcbc-81b8-4950-af50-46a7a4343613.md)
  - A proposal for a SeattleJS talk that I never ended up posting
- [In a Perfect World: My Dream Identity Management System](3f7019fb-74ea-4de9-bfb1-3985e0b79482.md)
  - a long-winded and not-yet complete essay that should probably be broken out into separate pages under the Lean Notes model
- [Doing Out-of-Band Tokens Right](0072bc14-9ba6-4364-9762-4e3dcccf8a69.md)
  - describes how login should be implemented in the Dream Identity System
  - this originally sprouted out in a different phase of the notes tree, I think
  - this should probably live under Lean Notes and conjoin into the Dream IAM page
- A little bit about [Lockout and Breach](b3b63eda-ac0f-4b49-b48d-a3df1b8251cc.md)
  - currently titled "The Perils of Too-Heavy Protection"
  - Really, this is all about how Lockout is a form of Denial of Service
    - and recognizing that that's a class of vulnerability
    - and how it's the natural byproduct of Breach Protection
- [Sensitive Things You Might Not Have Realized Are Sensitive At Scale](88053124-144e-4e0f-922e-a97073a9030e.md)

## More security/opsec-adjacent thoughts

These might be a little sloppier, they came via [Messays](8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md) from messier eras of these notes:
