# exploring if there's a better way to do images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/ indicates that kubernetes doesn't really disrupt the docker image-registry paradigm, which sucks, and makes one of the current open questions with Plusku ("how should I do build images") all that much harder

cri-o suggests the possibility of other image formats at some point in the future so that's probably a point to watch

Might be possible to just run a registry "in-cluster" a la https://medium.com/@jmarhee/deploying-a-docker-registry-with-persistent-storage-and-local-only-access-on-your-kubernetes-1c6470d3611c

could also do "pre-pulling" for running an image built on the host which just sounds dicey and difficult https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#pre-pulling-images

If there's a better builder than the docker CLI, I don't know it's been built, but this seems to answer my question that Kubernetes has not come up with a better construction method than Dockerfiles

## this needs to be moved

TODO: move this section somewhere around [the Module Tree design notes](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md)

anyway Plusku should probably be using something more like Dockerfiles anyway

also, thinking now, maybe there'll be something like a "CI plugin suite" that has a specified directory to read as the Git root, and all the app plugins

also, new naming paradigm for Plushu: all plugins, instead of being prefixed "plushu", should be prefixed by the "project" whose philosophy they live under. so like the app-image-creation-from-git-hooks ecosystem should be one component, and the deploy-built-image-to-cluster should be another project that, like, kind of incorporates that?

## okay so here's one thing that can probably be better over images
