# Learning Journeys

Stuff I'm currently exploring

Kind of dovetails with [Lean Notes][], in a way, though Lean Notes tends to slice by aspect, and this tends to slice by technology.

[Lean Notes]:

## Subpage Expeditions

- [Kubernetes][k8s]

[k8s]: f7ab56ca-06db-4c96-808f-4d0b0ee47819.md

Header-wise, I'm thinking, as these start getting more subpage-populous, we might start categorizing by aspect - at that point, there might start to be real crossover with Lean Notes - maybe every Lean Notes section might get its own "hands-on behind-the-scenes notes from my own learning jouney", like a Talk page?

## IPFS

I installed IPFS to see about experimenting with it as a replacement for sites like Thingiverse, Soundcloud, stuff like that. Also have some ideas around putting a name layer around IPNS and Tor addresses

## Rust

Went ahead and installed `rustup` so I could build Xi, so, hey, might go and try learning Rust. Might do that as part of my general looking-into of WebAssembly.
