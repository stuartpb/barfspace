# Old hardware notes

These mostly date back to when I was just planning the cluster, not really rolling it out:

- [Raspberry Pi for System Components](c25a1b6a-875b-4fde-96c0-98464511170b.md)
- [Sourcing More Chromebooks for x64-Power](5ad7f8ad-00fa-4df1-b99c-aba20b89f222.md)
- [Optimizing for Flash Media](e64f550b-a14e-4ca8-a68a-0b88a07051e1.md)
