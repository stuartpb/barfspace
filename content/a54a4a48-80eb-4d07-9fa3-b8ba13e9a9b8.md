# Reflecting on Quests

This is a page to serve as a retrospective on the "Quest" structure that led to the first big organic boom of content native to these notes.

A couple of legacy Quests that went on the Barfspace Visions list have been moved here.

## The Structure and Style of These Quests

There's a whole question giving me [vertigo](3ef0ffc5-818e-4c16-be90-0a8bd6eb8778.md) again about how [this quest wasn't documented earlier][main issue 6], because of course we need a quest aggregating thoughts and progress on the description of thoughts and progress on quests.

[main issue 6]: 55527f74-8390-402e-8bb6-51161b7a8e67.md

- [ ] Note how the voice of quests is kind of like the voice of Git commit messages, and maybe there's something to be made of that.

## Writing and Maintaining These Quests

This kind of overlaps with that last quest, but this is less focused on what needs *to be added to the spec* and more about how the existing content needs to be *wrangled*.

- [ ] Complete the quest about splitting all these arcs into their own pages to give a great context for doing this review of everything written so far.
- [ ] Get a handle on all these places where you've written "we" or "I" where "you" would honestly make more sense.
- [ ] Round up all these loose musings that are currently sprinkled across unrelated quests from this commit.
  - We gotta get auto-commit back up and running, man. (This'd be one of those instances where "you" wouldn't make sense to swap in.)
