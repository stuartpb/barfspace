# Utilizing Databases

## Previously

How to store and work with data is necessary for [Implementing User Accounts](c6891500-92fd-4774-9a14-d734d99bbdb4.md)

## Why build on a datastore?

Why program against a remote server instead of just using your local files (and then letting some networking thing handle making that distributable)?

If you build on a database API instead of a raw filesystem, then your app doesn't have to run on a node with storage, or make some kind of high-overhead NFS connection/replication scheme to network its storage.

It also lets you scale out.

Or, as I put it in 2013:

> Why not just write everything to the filesystem on the same server as the app?
>
> for all the reasons 12 factor is good
>
> you can swap out your code server without touching your content, and you can add more code servers
>
> You can have one server handling all the memory and disk juggling, and your app server focusing on putting things together while it waits

## meta note from original trello board

I think this was about how the rest of the notes from the original board were about specific datastores:

> It should have some best practices on structuring databases, like how internal UUIDs with a human-facing key that can be changed are good design, and how joins are important (and why that makes Mongo so braindead). Follow the cue from Implementing User Accounts

## Datastores You Could Use

- [MongoDB](83dc6af1-2423-4163-af45-9c395c5dc633.md)
- [RethinkDB](e80971e2-1ad4-4d6d-a355-dc019fea060f.md)
- [Redis](7594f87c-5c59-4206-90c6-12d36cf70d7c.md)

## Read on

Once you have data in place, the next thing you might want to explore is [Testing and Automation](a27bdf95-af28-4934-b95b-5135bf9e1e65.md)

NOTE: I think that's kind of a bad "next", kind of an artifact from the original linear structure of all this
