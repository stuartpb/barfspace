# Lean Notes Style

## Separation of instruction and education

Lean Notes wants to keep instruction separate from education, so if you've already had the education, you can refer back to the instruction without your eyes glazing over.

Lean Notes explains *why* it does things, but not *what* it's doing. It's expected that you can figure out *what* it's doing by reading the documentation, *an educational section on Lean Notes* (new), or otherwise Googling.

## Be dry, be direct

There's no advantage to alienating readers by injecting my personal interests and opinions into a completely unrelated lesson. This is basically something a bunch of writers do when they're insecure and they want validation for everything. Some common manifestations:

### Cutesy "comedy"

I know I'm funny. I'm a fucking published comedy writer. I don't need to validate my sense of humor by inflicting it on a semi-captive audience (who shouldn't need to share *any* tangential interests or beliefs to follow). I'm not going to distract from the point by trying to think up a clever, pithy pun title that makes finding what I want harder to understand.

What writers imagine readers think: "I want to write audio - oh, must be this page labeled "Sounds Good To Me"! Ha-yuk! Whoever wrote that title must be one *funny guy*."

What readers actually think: "Fuck this guy."

## Command with context

Let's say you're navigating a dungeon and you have a guide in your hands. You come to a split and the guide says "go right". Uh, no, guide, you're not my boss.

A good guide says "If you go left, you'll walk 15 feet and then a ledge will give way to reveal a pit of spikes. Go right." That way I go "oh, okay, I don't want that" and the guide saves me time and pain.

Similarly, if it says "If you go left, you'll face three skeleton warriors that you shouldn't face unless you have some kind of high-power projectile weapon. Go right", and I have an M15, I can go "oh, well then, I can take these guys" and go left anyway.

Lean Notes explains the factors involved in every action, because bare commands without context are meaningless.

## Know what changes with time

So much of the tutorials I've read have been incomprehensible because they were centered around things that just aren't true any more.

## Cut redundancy

You get smart, fast-moving writing by not repeating things. That's not going to trip people up- people read at their own speed, and can re-read past passages as much as they want. You say it once, you've said it a thousand times (or however many times they need to read it).

There's no reason to rate-limit readers by putting the same lesson twice: all that does is halve the impact of each iteration. Covering a little old ground when showing it in a new light is fine, but expounding on things we all know is how you make eyes glaze over (because the alternative would be wasting the time and energy required to read empty words).

## Opinionated, but starkly

Lean Notes does turn its nose up at some things and heartily embrace others: in general, though, the things that Lean Notes is opinionated towards are things that don't impose their own personal layers around you. For instance, Lean Notes is opinionated against jQuery (because it abstracts everything about the DOM into its own slower, more complex DOM), but wild about Git (because it's basically just tools for handling sha1'd dumps).
