# Here's the News with Me

I'm still trying to reconcile this with [Right Now](84grq-16d12-65bj6-m6bt5-s1h4a) - this is more reflective than that? Like, this is meant to talk about what I Definitely Did, whereas Right Now is what I'm "doing", which frequently never actually happens.

Ultimately, it sounds like that's more of a problem with me, but until I can get a handle on it, I'm gonna charge forward with these two separated nodes.
