# Collaborative Content Collections

These are projects that'll do best with lots of people contributing to them.

- [OPWS](144ec8bd-d6cb-47b7-aa60-7220f6d5b4f2.md)
- [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words (ODRW)](fd9ccf36-f6e0-47bb-a456-6f14e669b304.md)
- Keyboard shortcut collection? Is that still a thing?
- [envigor](265f23de-445d-44d3-acfc-66e316cb03a2.md) is kind of like a search for all hosted service/infrastructure providers
- Perspective Quantities
- [a copylefted mindfulness resource](e8817b38-0c9e-406e-a9f2-923b869dba94.md) is something a bunch of people would be more qualified to write than me
