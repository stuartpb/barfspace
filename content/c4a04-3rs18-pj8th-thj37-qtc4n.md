# Old hardware notes

These mostly date back to when I was just planning the cluster, not really rolling it out:

- [Raspberry Pi for System Components](r9d1p-tm7bg-0y9dg-4r8s2-h25rb)
- [Sourcing More Chromebooks for x64-Power](bbbzh-b80zb-ghbk7-5bm85-rkwg2)
- [Optimizing for Flash Media](ws7na-2x19v-48ad2-gbh2g-70mg1)
