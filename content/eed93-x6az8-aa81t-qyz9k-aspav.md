# Stuartup / Unusual Studio, But It's Local

So, this note's going to be my central point of operations for this whole consultancy thing I'm currently pursuing, which is part of [my overall quest to be self-sustaining][job] (which this originally encapsulated - if you're seeing a link to this page, you probably need to go up a scope).

## Subnotes for offering tutorship

- Drafts for an ad:
  - [First Draft](cmq9m-0f71r-p79mg-cmnh8-zrkg6)
  - [Second Draft](4af0s-tyxkv-2z9gp-1ak9m-faa44)
- [The (Local) Flow](azqav-0c667-m88jy-epbtm-b2808)
- FAQ
  - [for parents](1f2j0-dwgxj-2w9ez-qr8vh-d5saf)
    - this was basically drafted in response to scammers, which I didn't realize at the time, and it kind of soured me on this whole idea

## thoughts

Ought to iron out your terms. Should there maybe be some kind of contract to sign?

## status

I did get an email from someone who was interested, and it's my own dumb fault for not following up with them.
