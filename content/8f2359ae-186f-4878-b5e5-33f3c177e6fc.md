# Messays

Mediations and Musings, in long form and shorthand quips

## making this page work

This is a lot of mixed-up content with a lot of legacies.

I'm thinking it should just become a hub for a bunch of different lenses, and the old projects that led into this can be expanded into "maybe put your note on these pages" (they could be "fixed" lists, but there's no real good reason to keep that kind of history in the era of Shotclock Barfspace)

Here are some of the lenses I'm picturing:

- Meditations, as summaries of pages that are to keep in mind when designing.
  - I was stuck on "how can I keep the spirit of brevity that lied in the original Meditations?" And, while it might be possible to launch some kind of Zen Koans Index at some point in the future (maybe part of the Fresh Book of Bell Air?), for now, the best idea I can think of is to link to pages giving more detail with a pithy summary of the content.
  - And maybe more pithy summaries as subitems in the list.
  - Maybe just bring it back as, like, The Zen of Specs, or something like that. Maybe something like The Cluetrain Manifesto: Theses of Good Design or something like that. (What was Zote's thing in Hollow Knight?)
  - So basically the Laconic Wiki from TVTropes.
    - (Hey, that's another way to do attached foreign trees with different "versions" of content at the same name!)
- the [Raw page](a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md). (a lot of what's here should really be there)
- [Worse Is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md), A Theme Page (can also be called out to by all the "barfspace meta" that aims to be like that)
  - [This subpage](79558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) that's an intersection between those writings and [the Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), which is also sort of a Messays hub
  - Note that things have been moved from this page to that one: things should also be *copied* from the Raw page to here (and some things should move from here to there, and from Worse is Better to here, and... you get the idea - the only direction that doesn't move is WiB to here, because I already did that move)
- Right, Secure, Robust and Strong (repurpose Stuartpb on Security for this?)
  - This also sounds a little Method-Lab-Adjacent (many of these are - maybe there ought to be a joint hub for that?)
- The Tavern, for messays that don't fit into an existing hub yet (ie. they are Looking For Group, which is a bagtent phenomenon I should describe)

## orignal page begins here

This index is where I'm saying things where I have something to say about them, apropos of (more or less) nothing. Synthesizing full-length articles is hard, and most of the time I feel like it'd just be diluting the impact of the kernel of the matter.

This was originally supposed to be a set of guidelines surrounding the drafting of technical specifications, but as it sprawls in scope, it can also be interpreted as a set of guidelines around any sort of design, and, in a broader interpretation, as [an abstract philosophy of life][ZAMM] (with shout-outs to the driving philosophies of others).

All opinions expressed are my own, except the Robustness Principle was Jon Postel's.

Also cribbing from [The Design of Everyday Things][] and [The Pragmatic Programmer][].

Questions? Comments? Contributions? Requests for clarification? Contact me about it however you want. (In an earlier formulation, this was "leave an issue on this repo", which isn't as meaningful now that the repo is so broad.)

TODO: fix that link, I don't even know how issues work any more, this is part of the stuff I should figure out in [getting my shit together][GYST]

## A quick note on the name

I'm actually thinking this page might be switched back to being called Musings, like the version that was left in barfspace was called when barfspace expanded to incorporate more than just remnants from the old meditations repo. It's not like my musings are all that deep, and I feel like I'd rather have the word "meditations" reserved for, you know... [actual meditation][Ness].

## The Format

Each md file should be about the size of a GitHub issue comment, one that'd be appropriate posted in many issues, and at the same time appropriate in none. They should stand alone, [like a dandelion seed forever drifting on the wind, by which we may know the universe][seed].

## More Meditations

These were the meditations that were split off into "Musings" in barfspace - if memory serves, they're the files that "weren't done yet". More details on [the former Musings page][Musings].

- [We Are Our Context][]
- [Evergreen Targeting][] (this probably ought to move to Spec Lab or somewhere like that, as it's a conceptual invention for practical application)
- [When to Copyleft][], which could probably be moved to a branch of Lean Notes on The Inventive / Creative Process that applies for all the other contexts, which could probably take a big chunk from the pages currently in the Commissary as well, as they get ported in from Trello

## Deeper Musitations

I've made a separate page collecting ideas that I figures I "could write a whole book on" (figuratively speaking), and a bunch of thoughts on their history. [Delve deeper.][booky]

[booky]: e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md

You know, I haven't quite been following the "everything should be boiled down to a certain size" thing. I wonder if I should maybe fork off a "True Meditations" page, like how Reddit has "True Reddit" and that whole meme? I'd say "maybe a bunch of this stuff should be kicked back to Musings and this can be a nexus for the reduced scope of Meditations", but this page has kind of become a higher-level nexus: I think it's more that a lot of this content should get kicked out to further branch pages, and this can be the index for "pages collecting different kinds of writing on various multi-faceted contexts" as I try to figure out what kind of categorization is conducive to my being able to produce writing on them.

UPDATE: see "making this page work" above for a more concise version of this, maybe Artifact this away

## On tone and neighbors

I try to keep the thoughts here kind of zen-like and stoic (though I haven't been thoroughly consistent on the path to this page - there are probably one or two above that are somewhat misfiled at the moment), but there are pages that are a bit more introspective and moody on the [raw page](a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md).

## Also kind of musing-like

I'm not sure if this page should be the primary "category" for these, but:

### this is the closest page to a primary I could think of

- [Best Practices for Login Tokens][surpass-but-for-nilpass]

[surpass-but-for-nilpass]: 0072bc14-9ba6-4364-9762-4e3dcccf8a69.md

### it definitely works as, like, an affiliate musing

And, like, these were all arbitrary links I sorted pages into when I was first destructuring the repo, and I went many-to-one because I wanted it to be straightforward, but now the bagtemt glow cloud is really a-rollin' and it's no big deal if everything just sticks to everything
