# bagtent

This is an index page for pages that talk about bagtent, ie. the tooling and structure of these notes

## historical remark

this ought to be incorporated into whatever history of bagtent/barfspace+LN/notes.stuartpb.com is drafted: https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/issues/3 was where I originally came up with the architecture

## Notes

- [the original bagtent braindump][barfbarf], which I've tried to split out (only one original digression still lives there now) into a series of sub-notes per overall cohesive "thought":
  - [design for bagtent-sprout and bagtent-top-links][sprout/top-links]
    - the [did you mean][] design doc that's barely even bagtent-related
  - [thoughts on a style guide and best practices][sgbp]
  - [extending and enhancing the basic bagtent model][tentacion]
  - [notes on mixing content types][mixing] (kind of interplays with "extending")
  - [thoughts on "aliases" for short, fixed page names][alias]
- [thoughts on a renderer][renderer]
- [Borkflowy, the Bagtent Accordion concept][borkflowy]
- [Bagtent Intelligence Gathering stuff][BISNES/BIGDOG]
