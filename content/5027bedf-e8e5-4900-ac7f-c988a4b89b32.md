# Possible household-dns implementation

This was the possibility I saw for Stubernetes and went "nah" thinking I'd use k8s_external instead

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/coredns.md

another similar tutorial that references that one for KubeFed (in alpha): https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/ingress-service-dns-with-coredns.md

## on etcd

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/

https://hub.helm.sh/charts/incubator/etcd or https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/etcd seem less elaborate, and less deprecated

## probably gonna go with this serving a .internal zone

I was also thinking about using the old technique to connect directly to hosts that'd otherwise be hosted externally by having them be CNAMEs to LoadBalancer, which this wouldn't support...

Eh... that might be something External-DNS can handle, whether to prefer the DNS entry suggested by LoadBalancer or Ingress (maybe with the help of some labels/annotations)?
