# Open Modular Mouse/Keyboard Platform

[This adjustable 3d-printed mouse](https://gizmodo.com/3d-printed-replacement-cover-makes-your-mouse-infinitel-511624645) seemed cool, but it's proprietary.

What'd be cool would be to have something like this, but SACRED and copyleft

It'd also be nice to have a 3D-printable / open-sourceable base for building, say, RGB LED keyboards (ie. using WS2812s)

But also, it'd be cool to have a clear platform for, say, adding a screen and keyboard to the mouse

And I'd be cool just basing the design on taking apart an existing cheap mouse like [this one](https://www.amazon.com/TECKNET-6-Button-Ergonomic-Chromebook-Notebook-Grey/dp/B01BC4TXXC/)

Other cool mouse features I've seen and love that should be integrable into this platform:

- Swappable pad material (Sidewinder Mouse)
  - This is also useful for wear-and-tear
- Seperating charging cables that can be used for data to reduce wireless lag / use the mouse while it charges
  - the Sidewinder had a magnetic dock
    - theirs was a little *too* easy to put on / take off
    - weak connection eventually led to the entire mouse falling apart
  - the Logitech G700S has a special-formed USB plug
  - an open platform could have any kind of adapters
  - the [Aivia Uranium][] appears to have a retracting cable in its base
    - This could maybe work like a vacuum cleaner: if you push a release switch (which you can click to lock as released, if it's your style), the cable will pull out with the mouse as you undock it
- Dock
  - Using this as a docking anchor for a retracting cable seems like the best combination
- Recharging to a AA battery
  - my Razer Habu didn't have this
  - the Sidewinder and G700s do
- Onboard profiles
  - Not requiring host software
- Screens / small LCD displays
  - particularly thinking of [Electronic Grenade's "Computer Mouse"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLjFe7Lzjs8)
  - Gigabyte's [Aivia Uranium][] has a little screen/monitor in its base station / dock / anchor / hub
  - the Sidewinder mouse had a like 10x40 display that'd show your current DPI on change
- LED strips
  - My current mouse has 3 R/G LEDs, which it uses to display battery life
- Tilting wheel
- Wheel brake toggle
  - My G700s has this and it's my favorite thing ever
  - It's worth noting that this can be implemented virtually if you use a virtualized wheel via touchpad
- Lots and lots of buttons
  - the pattern I'm loving from my current mouse is 4 thumb buttons, which I use for back-and-forth as well as Ctrl and Shift
  - it also has 3 Pointer Side buttons, and one button intended for system use in the center, next to the Wheel Brake
- Configurable DPI / acceleration / smoothing
- Gyro, because hell why not
- Touchpads / swipe strips, like Apple's new mice!
- Scrollballs
  - Emulatable with touchpads a la Steam Controller
  - Physical ones are cool for 3D rotation manipulation
  - that old Apple Mouse has a teeny tiny ball with no inertia
- thumbsticks / POV hats / pucks / [nubs](https://xkcd.com/243/)
- Mechanical weight/size configuration
- Cord anchor
- Configurable buttons
  - ie. hair triggers versus hard-clickers
- Modular buttons
  - On top of making buttons re-configurable, it also lets you service them better
- Attached wristrest, hell why not
- Built-in keyboard

## Building something like this

[Electronic Grenade's build video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUHn_u4RbIk) lays much of it out
