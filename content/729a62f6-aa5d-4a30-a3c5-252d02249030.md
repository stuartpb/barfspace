# Reworking the Unusual Studio Project List Website

The current relationship between the website and the Project List repo could be better.

- [x] Create a GitLab group for Unusual Studio.
- [ ] Move the website stuff to a GitLab Pages repo.
- [ ] Figure out how the Projects page should work.
  - [ ] Right now, I'm thinking the best thing would be keeping the Projects repo separate, and then integrating it as a submodule of the website Pages repo.

note that on I think the "more work on Projects" page I noted that the site should really be overhauled to read from the database dynamically, as well as the dataset for these notes and more in the future
