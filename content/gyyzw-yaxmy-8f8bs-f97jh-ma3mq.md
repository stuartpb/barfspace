# On doing things the old way, briefly, as introduction

My current example is [the way I briefly had Pomerium set up](st2tq-tv937-g58jw-c9pmw-1ydr1)

I feel like it's worth showing this whenever "the old way" is still relevant in a lot of cases, ie. when it's not something that's deprecated at all

## actually, it's more than didacticism

Sometimes you need to write out intermediate constructions that you know won't last for too long because you need to iron out any kinks that come in the transition, and you want to reduce the number of changes that could be the origin for each problem as much as possible at each phase, so you know what needs to be fixed before implementing the next phase of the metamorphosis.

I suppose this is also the idea of Socialism into Communism, and there's probably also some kind of gender metaphor connection lying around here somewhere
