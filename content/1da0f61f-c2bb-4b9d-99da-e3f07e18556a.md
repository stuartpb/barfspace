# Operation Trapper Keeper

This is now the main note under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] for the continuing work of integrating outside content that began with [Project Akira][]. It's kind of a cursor for where a bunch of legacy work is at: a base camp to address newer developments in while trying to disassemble incomplete thoughts from a different time into pieces of a newer world, for structures from before the notes started coming in.

[Project Akira]: dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md
[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

I guess this could also be thought of as a sort of Ellis Island, a receiving port for outside content, since so much of it pertains to integrating material from my pre-merger writings.

Other work to continually improve on Barfspace is listed under [Questesque Barfspace Operations][bops].

## anyway

2019-05-07: Making a note here that I should revisit the Project Akira Great Notes Consolidation page to reflect on its thoughts as they pertain to how the issues I was writing about then have evolved and are evolving.

(a note here about developing a more robust archaeological infrastructure, inspired by a reread of the notes on Project Akira, has been moved to [how-i-roll's Tomb][])

ALSO, [petlogs should get merged into these notes][petloggins] (I believe this is now tracked elsewhere, so this line can probably get cut)

[petloggins]: 7d504fda-8d04-4ac9-9332-319dd52b1930.md

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]
