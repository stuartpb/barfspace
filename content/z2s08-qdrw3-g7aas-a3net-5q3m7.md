# Bagtent as a Democratic Wiki

You could have the default file for each tree even just be "this is what most users have for this file - here is a network graph from here"

"This blob is being displayed as it is the most common revision in the most trees."

you could have this be hierarchical, but by bodies-of-representation - each party to whatever federation compact has a tree that counts as a "vote", so it'd be like "This is the canonical version of the document since it's the one at this name for Google, Mozilla. See also Apple's version."

so if you wanted to start contributing to the wiki, you'd need to find a group that would accept your contributions into their tree

I keep thinking like "Where would this specifically for Bagtent be useful?" and then I realize: TV Tropes style federation *needs* to work like this. (Indeed, an "internal TV Tropes Rework" has been on my radar since the [earliest inklings of federating barfspace](nfwjw-tvvm0-gkb2e-k3xhv-h6f7k).) The naming headaches, the gushy fangirly content... all these things could be averted by having the cabals forced to implement an editor layer to curate examples and agree on acceptable compromises (while still allowing awful forum-like-wiki writing through a group that might choose to just have free-for-all merging - and their terrible tree is never selected as the merge origin).

the brilliant thing about this model is that it's essentially a turf war with *unlimited territory*. You can always cede a name / ID in favor of picking a new one and just adding a link on that page

It also works neatly for "friendly amendments"? I was going to say "the number of participants reflecting the change becomes higher when the author merges a patch", but...

Maybe groups need a "you must respond to others' changes within a week" membership criterion - otherwise, your content's fine, but it doesn't get counted in the tree calculation
