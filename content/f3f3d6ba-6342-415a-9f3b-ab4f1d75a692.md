# Project Akira

This is the ongoing endeavor to incorporate a bunch of my semi-abandoned writing projects into this Notes collection.

## Motivations

## Stuff to do now that the notes are all in one repo

- [ ] Update https://github.com/stuartpb/collected-writings
- [ ] Spin down the Lean Notes brand? At this point, the org has no repos: I honestly might as well just delete it, archive the lean-notes repo (noting in the repo description that it was merged here), and redirect leannotes.com to stuartpb.com
- [ ] Make a stub document for barf.space
- [ ] Steal from old stuartpb.plan
- [ ] Write a postmortem on stuartpb.plan
- [ ] Get back to updating Right Now (maybe move its entry link to the Root Note?)
- [ ] Actually start moving the Trello stuff to Lean Notes pages
- [ ] Write up an explanation of what the hell is going on

## Old plan stuff

There's currently a quest like this as "Owning Your Own Words" on [Barfspace Arc][]

[Barfspace Arc]: 5d6dccaf-195b-4010-a378-eb7a9626ec79.md

So yeah, TL:DR: I'm merging Lean Notes into Barfspace and renaming barfspace to notes.stuartpb.com.

Other ideas I don't think I'd written yet:

- The README is going to be turned into just a brief explainer that these are my personal notes
  - You are not expected to understand these, they are primarily just public to make it so it's as hard for me to lose my notes as possible
  - That you might be able to read them is a useful benefit that I may inconsistently cater to at times
  - When I'm trying to make them accessible, it's as much about making it so I don't forget myself when I come back and try to read them later, if not more, than about making them accessible to others
  - They're like code comments like that
  - These are a constantly-updating set of documents, unless stated otherwise
  - Feel free to get your own ideas from these notes, but don't go attributing anything more than the words to me
- The stuff in Lean Notes' README is going to get moved to a note
- The stuff in Barfspace's current README is going to get moved to a note, too, one that links to Lean Notes' old README as a kind of "oh, here's this whole other website just hanging out inside this one"
- The latter will become the "current root note" linked in the README, after the explainer of how it's just my notes
  - At the end: "With all these disclaimers out of the way, Click here to proceed to the current root note."
  - This part of the refactor might actually come before any of the merging stuff happens
- the barfspace repo will then be renamed notes.stuartpb.com
  - and the CNAME will change, obviously
- actually, I think barf.space should continue to live as its own repo...
  - okay, I'll make a new one for barf.space (since this one is currently "barfspace") that can be a born-stub with a README that just tells the story of Project Barfspace, and how it turned into my notes, and how there's a few pages that point toward what Barfspace is meant to embody within those notes
  - remaining pips here moved to [the name explainer page][], which the barf.space stub will probably enmesh with
- a bunch of other stuff that wasn't merged into Lean Notes is gonna need to get merged into here
  - the big one on my mind is Pitches and Scripts, because that's been like the Meditations that led to Barfspace in that I've had a bunch of tenuous and uncommitted files I wasn't confident enough in

## Owning Your Own Words

Should this really be called barfspace? That makes it a very "separate" project, and it's really transformed into something very tightly enmeshed with your identity; even Test Track 4 (which was your email address's domain name for a solid *decade*) became an uncomfortable side-brand, and that didn't even have "barf" in the name.

- [ ] Rename this repo to something else.
  - [ ] I've been thinking "notes.stuartpb.com", pretty much: keeps things from looking like I want anything here to be any sort of long-term publishing destination.
  - [ ] Figure out what to do with all these lingering references to "barfspace" around.
    - [ ] Turn them into links to [the name explainer page][]?
    - I guess if this becomes notes.stuartpb.com, then you'd just call the general conceptual space of zero-filter self-oriented incidental-publishing (ie. using any platform in this fashion, not just bagtent, which can be used in other fashions) "Open Notes", like "the Open Notes movement"
      - or maybe we'll call it XON, pronounced like "Exxon", for "*eXtreme* Open Notes" *(electric guitar, monster truck noises)*
      - [ ] List this on the [Barfspace Vision Quest list][BVQL], with a cross-reference on the [Network Neighborhood quests arc][NetNQ]
        - [ ] Draft content in a quest on Visions.
        - [ ] Plan deployment by moving an action plan beyond content out as the "Selling Bagtent" quest being moved to a general Network Neighborhood movement quest.
- [ ] Merge in Lean Notes, because at this point, if it's all just "my notes", there's no reason to hold the distinction across repos: graduation can just be a matter of a link "making it". It can just worke like, you know, Wikipedia: no "incubator phase" necessary.
- [ ] This would mean that the current README files of barfspace and Lean Notes would become new pages, and there'd be a *new* README
  - [ ] Progress more on the Meta track (like rereading my-old-bad-ideas and revisiting the Meta Collection) to feel like you've got a handle enough on this to write *another* level of "this page is in flux, here's what I can tell you about what it looks like" README (and see if you can then maybe subsequently do it less in the prior READMEs - remember to do a foreign tree merge).
  - another xkcd that captures what it's like to have truly unbridled organic development: [xkcd 1360][]
- [ ] It's worth exploring why I've become more ready to use a system like this instead of one of the things I've used in the past like Isues or Trello

It's funny: the consistent theme of all these bad ideas is that I was convinced that the thing inhibiting my creativity was the lack of a venue for it.

Though, actually, come to think of it... was I wrong? I mean, that's essentially what it took: look at how my output *exploded* once I found Cloud9.

So I guess it's actually kind of sad.

But yeah, another thing, as I put for an idea originally written down as "A Federated Wiki of StackOverflow-type questions answered with Octopress-type posts.":

> This seemed like a smart idea when I wrote it, but looking back, it's redundant to... Stack Overflow questions and Octopress posts. This idea failed one of the criteria I've only really come to understand in the last few years: "is there anything stopping the kind of user who'd know what to do with this from doing it themselves today?"

*(Update: in light of [what I'm doing right now with Lean Notes][leannotes#2] where I'm effectively turning it into a federated wiki of guides, that last one is especially hilarious)*
