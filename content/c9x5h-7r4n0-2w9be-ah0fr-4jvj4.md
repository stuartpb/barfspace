# Understanding Quadration

You know the Fibbonaci Sequence?

And you know how dividing any part of the Fibonacci Sequence gives you the Golden Ratio?

(that's actually kind of unrelated, so it should get cut, but it's interesting to note that that property is actually true of [any iterated sequanece])

And, like, say you had a keycode that was way deep in the fibonacci sequence, where the only way to get there is to keep on adding

(this is where the convergence towward phi thing makes sense to me, to show how this inevitable property works for arbitrary "keys")

so, like, imagine there's a secret that lets you briefly look into the future
