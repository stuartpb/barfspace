# PRIMER PRIME: Computers, as I understand them

This is, essentially, *the* history of computing that I want to write: one that covers all the little quirks that led to the world you *actually have to deal with* to work in technology today (the answers to most questions people have being "because that's what Ken Thompson needed to write Unix on his computer at Bell Labs in the seventies").

I'm going to sneak in a link to [this Rolling Stone article by Steward Brand that I painstakingly converted to HTML](https://github.com/stuartpb/spacewar-article), which taught me a lot about the state of the field in the early seventies, and is otherwise not easily available on the Web. I should *probably* ask the author for permission to rehost it at some point.

## Progress

So far, I've tried to write this from the beginning; as a result, I got about as far as 1890, and then I hit a roadblock since (the *really* interesting stuff doesn't happen for about seventy-five years.)

I should just start copypasting everything I've ever written when answering questions that start with "Why does my computer", and then by the end of it I'd probably have half the book written.

## What's written

So far, all that's written is a [Foreword and Introduction][], and a few paragraphs and headings for [Chapter 1: Everything Before the 1960s][Chapter 1].

I'm gonna just start listing ideas for subjects next below and linking off to stubs (which may then end up getting woven into some of the Lean Notes pages that touch on some of these topics).

## Chapter 2: The 1960s
