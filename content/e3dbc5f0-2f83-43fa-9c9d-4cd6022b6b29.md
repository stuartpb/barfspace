## Contour issues

- [extremely long explainer on external auth background / goals](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/2459)
- [a few other ingress auth headers](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/68)

## unrelated issues?

- [Provide support for integrating with external auth for TCP connections](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/2888)
- [Expose Envoy's network rbac filter configuration in contour](https://github.com/projectcontour/contour/issues/2971)
