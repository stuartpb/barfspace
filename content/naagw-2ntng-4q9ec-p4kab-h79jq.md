# end of 2019 Right Now

I last overhauled this page at the end of June 2019: [here](9bs4r-ccbhw-mrayg-164e4-zqx0n) is a snapshot of most of that content.

I've moved it into a subpage to copy/retrieve from, as much of its content was dedicated to my switching away from GitPod to edit these notes (written in a frantic hurry to commit before I ran out of time).

## Writeups

I'm making moves to get started writing [articles on some of the stuff I've invented](y5037-6d8gw-m2anh-h940t-mcqmb).

## The job thing

I'm waiting to hear back from two companies and, other than that, am kind of... stuck, idk.

## Firefox

In light of all the crap that's starting to happen around Chrome, I'm [moving to Firefox](fc7r5-6kzqt-4p9pq-c1jvg-vs8m4).

In doing so, I'm revisiting my old [Browser Extensions](aqwqk-rbhx4-6vanm-hm867-cfewx).

## Wedding stuff

I developed [lumpkin](jfyea-nmjmb-mb801-8ygha-tqv4h) for sending out our Save the Date emails, and will likely be hacking on it further to send out future wedding correspondence (like invitations).

## Alphabi

Just imported some pages from my [alphabi](n4ptf-q8bq9-4t8wp-km6nr-wnary) workspace

## Maker stuff

I've got these plastic clips holding a WS2812 strip on my desk. I intend to use this for some kind of productivity tool, but am currently stalled on not having the resources to dedicate a NodeMCU chip to running it.

Reminder here: it's supposed to be about reminding me to take a breath and meditate. Seeing how stressed out I've been lately, I think this is pretty important.
