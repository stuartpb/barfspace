## The stuff on this page is obsolete

It should go it a page describing the old behavior for historical purposes

the new best practice, after months of heavy use, has turned out to be simply [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md)

that said, this will probably be done by moving the content below and keeping this as the "best practices" node

## Postmortem: why did footlinks make sense?

(this should go to a separate Bagtent thought node on "searching links")

I think I wanted to be able to search "Link names" as a class to find pages (so I wouldn't get results from body content), and I wanted to make it possible to not search "link text" for when the text of the link had nothing to do with the page's "name", and unifying link searches to "lines specifying link targets" seemed like a solid way to enforce that.

In practice, this never really ended up being an issue: if you grep for text in square braces, you'll pretty much get what you're looking for. (And you can make it "only check inline with parentheses and start of lines followed by colons" if you really want to force that search - bottom line, it turns out inline links are the right form factor 99% of the time.)

Anyway, most of the time I've ended up being able to find a page by its first-level heading, so "search outbound links" was kind of a gratuitous concern. (Though it might not be in other Bagtent applications! But the headaches I ran into trying to use them would still be likely, enough to not make that a commonly-prioritized Bagtent pattern.)

Yeah, and, now that I think about it, the name used for a link can be as much chosen for "syntactic" reasons, and meaningless, as the name on the left side of the pair, so really, you just need to search any text in brackets!

EDITOR'S NOTE: I think this list might be too deeply nested to work with some Markdown rulesets - should really get its own page tree

- and this brings me onto the subject of redesigning bagtent-top-links:
  - it should really just show files matching the input term in links to them by how many references are pointing to the file
  - for square-square references, it's fine to count the left-side as a (presentationally) "parenthesized" match
  - and you can match the right-hand-side by looking for its URL definition line and displaying matches in those references as square-braced
  - and so a link that matches on both sides just counts twice, which is fine because it's double-appropriate
  - It's important to note that square-referenced (ie. ending `][]`) links will count as *square* matches
    - their left hand side isn't considered a candidate for a page point - they "don't specify" what page they match
      - I feel like they should still have a "verify this reference is used" token made, though
        - to be checked when encountering define lines,
        - for lint's sake if nothing else
        - like, an unreferenced link, or an unrigged one, should definitely warn, and maybe abort calculation altogether
        - or, you know... invoke rigging... which would be what you'd also do to conjure new (searching the left-hand side, or your missing right-hand token)
          - okay so that's why rig is a complex subscript that might involve node, or needs to be dumber
          - or, okay, rig (or some other script with a more complex name like Git's internals) is plumbing, for each file:
            - (note, this would be something underpinning, and probably using parts from, bagtent-top-links)
            - it outputs all parenthesized link lines
            - it can hold links that are specified as square in memory (a token list in Bash), but not a square that's been encountered and defined, for if that square comes around, what page to link to
            - Needs to have a behavior definable for what happens on multiple definition of a symbol (if different)
            - anyway, once the square is matched, it outputs any stored left-hand-sides as pointing to what the symbol pointed to
            - it only
            - definition lines that are never referenced can be the one instance where it will print a definition line
              - so lint can detect them,
              - garbage-collection can purge them,
              - scoring can maybe half-count them (though that sounds like a bad idea),
              - some other tool can ask where you'd like to insert a link to it in the document (which section/list)
                - this would work for tools that "spawn" pages, but don't sprout them from a hooked-up place
          - okay, so, rig is a more complex script, that lets you interactively pick from the top-ranking / best matching
            - (a second pass can present the contexts that contributed each match)
            - and if you want to rewrite your right-hand-reference
              - or maybe even your left-hand,
              - or, hell, maybe just drop you to that position in an editor because it turns out you were wrong about
                - this could be tricky if editing a line with multiple links? or what if the section changes enough?
                - I think that might be why you'd want the "surgical change without invoking an editor" command options
              - Maybe also... hmm, okay, so, use case for invoking an editor near the link position
                - in a VS Code context, opening the origin editor can be useful for cutting a section
              - maybe in ambiguous cases, it presents closest links to where the diff thinks the old link is by diffinw within the line,
                - and you pick specifically which of the ones you changed is the one to rig
                - and you drop back into the editor
              - another case where it might be ambiguous: I changed the original link to not match
                - and just to complicate the matter, say I added a new link that does match
                  - which is to say, I "moved the match", in a sense
                  - or did I just rephrase my search query to be more appropriate for reading?
                    - in this case, I'd probably want to take a suggestion through the interface for "Change This Right (or Left) Side Reference Token for Readability"
                      - that only presents the editor as a last-case scenario
                      - after displaying all the matching terms for the search
                      - and if there were none
                      - this can also rerun the search for rigging?
                      - what to do if there was a line like `[Linkup Name]:` and no path?
                        - I guess this is detected in the rigging process,
                          - (ie. which links to skip because they're already rigged)
                          - in the filtered line presenter, this is just done by filtering out all the non-empty-or-special-hook-termed (by addon script?) parentheses links
                          - and you can opt to change the right-name from this line in all references
                            - either "accuracy", pulling title and possibly other reference names as a "menu"
                            - or "brevity", which maybe suggests "initials" or even, hell forbid, numbers
        - okay, so that's what I was doing, I was like cargo-cult-imitating what I thought content inserted by tooling would look like
          - **EDITOR:** this line actually belongs to the style restrospective context this idea went down
    - all square-tag references are evaluated by going to see if there are left-sized matches that referenced them by name, and adding the page to their "referenced as" score (as if they were parentheses)
    - see, this is because left-hand references that don't match the page aren't counted, and the square has to count for itself, so one of these double-links doesn't get the redundancy bonus of a match that uses the term on both sides of a square-brace-quartet (ie. 'foo' to `[foobar][foobaz]`)
    - because we know any matching square-reference, we let the match point go to the evaluation that will happen for the square-reference implicit "right hand side"
    - if you really want the double points, you gotta spell it out twice (lines that match the token on the left and have right-side data get counted as "paren" matches)
  - you know, this isn't strictly Bagtent... or at least, it could also be used in other documentation-tree-authoring-tool contexts
  - anyway this is definitely WAY off course as a "style" conversation, it's jumped into a full tool respecification

## bagtent markdown style stuff

link names should be treated as more or less portable between documents, which is to say that there shouldn't be any words that are used consistently to refer to different documents in different contexts (like `[back]:` pointing to the "previous page", for some kind of sick cheap templating scheme). Doing stuff like that screws with the tooling heuristics, not to mention it makes it harder to move content around.

the one exception to this is links by number, which have all kinds of special handling in the tooling

## also

this has a few references lingering around in other notes before I had a certain place to put them, but footnotes should live close to their point of usage, because it makes trucking content across files easier. It also leaves fewer dead references that have no links in the body hiding in the gaps.

## in fact

I just wrote the Table of Contents for [Understanding Lua][], and I didn't even bother coming up with footnames for most of them - I just used inline links, since most of them were one-time and the name level of redirection didn't really help readability.
