# Learning Journeys

Notes I make as I explore various technologies.

Kind of dovetails with [Lean Notes][], in a way, though Lean Notes tends to slice by aspect, and this tends to slice by technology (though I expect those lines to blur going forward).

## Aside about making

[Everybody Gets a Factory][EGAF] is a similar cluster around discovering various technologies around personal manufacturing, sort of like a second draft around the blunt block-of-marble notes I initally take here.

[EGAF]: 8cbd867d-1a63-4d1f-9c83-cab019fe87bd.md

[Adventures in 3D Printing][3dp] is the general nexus for 3d-printing-related learning. Pages in the list below should be worked into that one (even if they're part of EGAF, probably, since the nature of that page is to be a more table-of-contents-y overview than EGAF's full narrative choose-your-own-adventure-y structure.)

## Tours?

not exactly an Expedition, but it occupies an adjacent headspace
