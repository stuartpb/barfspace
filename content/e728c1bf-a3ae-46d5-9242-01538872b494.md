# how I unfucked my windows 10 login

basically I did this: https://gist.github.com/CHEF-KOCH/d531d9474dd40a45d19c460db29422a8

note that I couldn't figure out how to edit this stuff in RegEdit, possibly because I'd broken the file in some whay that it doesn't read in RegEdit, but anyway I was able to delete those values from the SAM from stushiba using chntpw
