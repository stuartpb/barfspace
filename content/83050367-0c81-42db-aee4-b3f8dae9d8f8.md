# on conjuring without having a page in mind

## examples from these notes

[this one](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md) had just a parenthetical "put this somewhere in the meta indices"

## on CI

you could make the publish branch enforce one-way reachability - or, gosh, even two-way (though I certainly don't write my notes like that)

## tooling

you can solve this so easily with just "take the result of `bin/validate`" (or whatever simpler bagtent-orphans tooling-or-port would be appropriate here, to get the list of orphans), and then "drop them in a file" and "link that file from whatever page you're counting as the center of your universe"

you could also maybe have some kind of natural tree creation, though?

that'd be a neat Bagtent tooling feature: Automatic Table of Contents by way of capturing subsets of

maybe that'd be (I think I trailed off and started looking into [Notebook Systems](1c6def61-2252-45a9-a15f-a42f5b33b3e6.md) here)

## where was I going with that?

I think it was "one of the kinds of semantic refactor I'd like to be able to conjure easily is splitting subheadings to separate pages"

you could even preselect these by reducing them to first-level - then all you'd need is a "bump this section one level of headings up" editing extension
