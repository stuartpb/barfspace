## Straight-Up Department Business

Oh hey, this is new! Most of the visitors here have just been in to visit the old standing committees. Of course, the old standing committees haven't met in months...

Been off working on necklaces and dead-end jobs wot not, moving apartments... not doing any work on improving the note structure... 'works good enough for what we're', they say... no vision, these lads... no sense of adventure...

Oh! Sorry! What was it you came here about, again?

Some changes to the Project area? Maker projects becoming a bigger deal? Well, that's nice, sounds like it's settling itself out nicely... turning into a real lived-in-room feel, it is...

Oh? And some revisions to the structure of Diaries? Physical build logs intersecting the style of software mission logs? There ought to be an index for "Firfox journeys" or "VS Code endeavors" across machines? Hmm, I suppose...

Anyway! You can just go ahead and file those plans with the - hmm. I suppose we never actually did establish a sort of "general improvements" body... that's become something of the job of the Department, commissioning bodies, which rapidly took up most of the work in the department as their initiatives swept through...

...You know what? I'm looking at this here list of departments, and it seems I got caught up in this same sort of conundrum a while ago. Most of what we were calling "Department jobs" were just importing and working with out-of-tree sources!

I suppose we were on something of a kick, weren't we? When all your job is importing from an outside source, *everything* looks like an outside source! And, I suppose that's true, in a way. Even the most navel-gazey notes-for-notes sake (not like this, what we're doing right here right now, this doesn't count) are "importing" human language.

But "taking notes on how I'm breaking my printer" are a far cry from "duplicating links to an outside issue tracker"!

I think Trapper Keeper was too proud, too intent on being the "new order", the ascendant administration. TK's institutions wanted to grow into the bodies that would still facilitate the notes years down the line.

So it goes.

I suppose nothing ever *truly* dies in the Noteball. We can refile Operation Trapper Keeper

We've been playing a little Katamari Damacy lately. (There should be a page about what games we're up to on the Switch, not just Steam.) And that game is all about just rolling a ball through an ordered world with no regard toward *building* anything. Only unmaking.

But this department's job is as much about keeping that organic balance between order, description, categorization - and chaos, growth, defying categorization - that the Notes need!

... wasn't there a word for that, again?

## Headquarters and Reflection Points

- [The Top-Level README Committee](nta2y-akyde-mq8s9-fcg9c-sqrrc) is a meta page for the landing page that introduces these notes
  - The root note itself doesn't have a meta structure, but:
  - [The Right Near Office](vqf81-6650g-8ka3r-k582q-b2vnh) collects Thoughts on the First (Non-Meta) List of the Root Note
  - [The Edge Surveyors](de94w-bgxp6-8p9wh-fsrta-s3qg0) (Thoughs on Miscellanea and the Last and Latter Lists of the Root Note)
    - [Collecting Links and Putting Them Somewhere](df3m6-zy76j-ce97x-z8zps-qh50j) (Organizing and Expanding the Linkdump)
- [Operation Trapper Keeper](3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca)
  - handles the reintegration of outside content from the [Loose GitHub Repo Era](krj3r-7ac6y-w99v9-f6x54-zjrrx) and later
  - This narrow definition is because the Department has basically turned into Trapper Keeper
    - The original idea was for the Department to hold all note structure development
    - but it's turned out that most structural development happens without coordination
    - This refactor should maybe be revisited, with Trapper Keeper getting a new parent org dedicated to merging in old content
    - especially since it all overlaps the Historium and/or the Consulate
    - and, like, you could almost consider Linkdumps to be integration, in a sense
    - I guess I'm not doing that because, at this point, anything older counts as Archaeology?
    - So I guess the division is that anything new is Trapper Keeper, and anything old is Archaeology
    - But yeah, they should share a house
    - And, like, Project Weavers isn't either one because it's not importing notes content...
  - [The June Judgment](pyw3b-her8e-48awm-xxhbq-kdngd) defines the remainder of Trapper Keeper's original mission
  - [Camp Papalima](9xr5p-sec7k-w6a4n-nebsb-qfmmp) tracks the remaining loose ends from Importing the Petlogs
  - [Old Dot Plan Excavation Crew](na999-h6tqn-gra5p-tvqtv-26vwe)
- [Archaeology Force](xance-6ev1z-rb8tq-dw3f5-caz42), the historic-content-extricators for the [Notegraph Historium](rjnhy-tyar8-05aw9-svgbr-akn86)
- [The Project Weavers](8pczw-ptgg2-jq828-tnn6g-bfrqg), integrating project content
- [The Beyonder Consulate](w72r2-yzcwa-01a5f-1fwvr-85ay7) (Covering notes outside this note structure, how they're operating, links or why you can't see them, etc)
  - Thoughts on the Beyonder Consulate's jurisdiction [here](7jawm-c6j0q-r79rr-80gxb-9qc8z)
  - This is also arguably overlap with the Academy since it's about documenting and studying existing behavior
  - [The Shadow Curtain](wm7ba-3ycgc-wn8h2-pjnsv-xny45), for public notes about the creation of a body/bodies of bagtent notes in separate repositories with different levels of disclosure
