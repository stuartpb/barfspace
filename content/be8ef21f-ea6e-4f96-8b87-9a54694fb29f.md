# NodeMCU and Espressif chips

This can be a page aggregating all my NodeMCU notes and projects, including documentation I've been yoinking.

- [postdark][]
- drawrest, a simlpe HTTP-to-screen-or-LEDs gateway

[postdark]: f83f237b-3d81-4e2b-85d1-4686cb1f2e49.md

## support libraries

- spitblit
- httpserv, a more-complete version of the incomplete Lua one in the nodemcu tree

there're another couple projects that are currently just in the planning stages that I'm currently thinking I'd use an ESP8266 for:

- [a slideshow module for postdark][postrs]
- [a WS2812 necklace][necklace] (there should probably also be a page for WS2812s, really, especially since I'm planning to try controlling them from the Raspberry Pi at some point)

[postrs]: 6a9b637f-17b4-45e4-92ac-ae7161894b8f.md
[necklace]: 6dc617ce-7fc0-4c57-937e-2656af78f664.md

I might use something like this for a future revision to my [Infinity Gauntlet][MBIG] design (though, at this point, I think I'll hold off on anything like that for a few years until a really good Infinity Gauntlet model comes along to use as a basis, since I'm realizing now that the one I'm basing my current build on is kind of rough and clumsy)

[MBIG]: 1647ef1d-19ba-4367-96cf-ef5bfc3a857b.md

## Data Sheets and Pinout Diagrams

https://hackaday.io/project/61727-rhobythe-social-robot/log/157461-ke32-wrover-c10-pinout has a couple good links:

- [this image summarizing the pinout for the breakout chip I'm using][ESP32 pin table]
- [the underlying datasheet for the ESP32][ESP32 datasheet]

## Old Journals

These are pages pertaining to the ESP8266 from the old Petlogs structure:

- [stukilla 2017-12-02](d5228011-2fa7-4766-89f8-22a31be55ed7.md) and a small but significant update [2017-12-04](d4619b36-d2dd-4061-8482-ac72469daa38.md)
- [stuzzy 2018-09-08](51c0ec80-d01b-4dc5-9c31-61bb6e0bf153.md)

## New Journals

These are entries more or less from the new petlogs structure (though sometimes I might not bother rigging them in there):

- [Getting the WS2812B strip to light](778c8e75-ae00-4f8d-94c2-03d73bd9c755.md)
  - [Continuing to Try with the ESP8266](d5456d01-f45d-48d5-962b-81198e93062e.md)
- [Flashing an ESP-01](57243b51-a205-4df6-92b2-041c15176865.md)
