# Rolling Out the Welcome Wagon

This is a quest to explain notes.stuartpb.com to others.

- [ ] Keep on writing [the updated "How I Roll: Writing" thing.][writing take 2].
  - [ ] Work in pages for the deeper underlying patterns / concepts aggregated under [the meta index][metadex].
- [ ] Write intelligible pages about some subjects.
  - [ ] [Explain the name.][explainer page]
  - [ ] Maybe salvage some of the thoughts from the old meta stuff
- [ ] Describe how this is kind of like Gists, but not owned by GitHub, and with tools to interlink
  - [ ] Talk about how it's nice to have people have separate repositories for owning their own words, and to just leverage the existing hypertext Web infrastructure (or maybe IPFS / IPLD)
- [ ] It really should be underscored how atypical all this stuff I'm doing with Barfspace is for me.
  - Like, I'm generally *huge* about names
  - This is part of how One Of Those Things With Me
  - Also, this is kind of like how Wordnet does definitions?
    - Also, wow, is there another project that tk defintions so deeply
    - Does Wordnet have a crossreference property on Wikidata?
      - How does Wikidata manage reification disagreements?
        - Is reification an appropriate term for "defining what a word/symbol means"? That's how I've been using it. Shit, wait, isn't that Quiddity? Oh dear, it's the [Metaquiddity][] vortex again.
