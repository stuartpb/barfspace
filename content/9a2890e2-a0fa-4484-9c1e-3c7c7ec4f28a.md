# The Method Lab

(Not to be confused with [the Arizona-based video production agency of the same name name](http://www.methodlab.com/).)

This is my home base for [methods engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_engineering) and that class of thing. [Time and motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study), things like that.

It's somewhere between Lean Notes protips, Projects, and Messays (especially the [big ones][] in which they share the original impulse of having dedicated repos created for them in the Pre-Notes Era of [My Old Bad Ideas][MOBI]), as well as the [Wellness and Fitness index][WAFI] and some degree of all the other stuff that's linked off from Right Now

[big ones]: e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md
[WAFI]: 2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md
[MOBI]: f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md

What gets drafted here: procedures, standards, guidelines... all that fun boring stuff

These are influenced by the thoughts collected at [The Spiral Mountain of Design and Social Psychology](458f8a16-f237-4f8e-8e17-474408732536.md)

see also [Component Projects](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md), many of which can feel like abstract methods at times

- [Project HOARD](ab4e905a-db98-4ca2-a52d-93eaf8dc8ca4.md)
  - [2K19 Nexus](7b3283fd-ba8a-4fd9-a496-f4f50d31dba3.md)
  - [Baggage packing procedure](b1cc9089-e36b-4727-80f8-911c882d12d6.md)

Other stuff to be merged in there is listed in the repos leaning toward merging in under "Merging Versus Supporting Existing Works" list on the [Barfspace Operations][BOPS] page. (SACRED?)

[Extreme Open Notes](2f6140a5-b798-4f5f-a1c6-981f8bbf8aa1.md) is an offshoot specifically thinking about generalizing the structure around [Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md), currently kept here in case I ever move forward with that

BISNES/BIGDOG could probably be introduced here

[BOPS]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md

Kind of like this is the [household experience page][HousE], potentially - right now it's just a thing about dishwashing but that's still procedure-like

[HousE]: 4f20d294-9c5a-4f0b-913c-cbce172a0325.md

Specs I think make more sense in dedicated, structured repos, but there definitely might be a shadow nexus somewhere on here for unstructured thoughts on specs

at some point [my loadout system][Loadout] might be turned into some kind of template, which would go here.

[Loadout]: d9cb40c4-b0c0-49c4-94cc-5033dd9316f7.md

[Triage methods for early development](e893511e-51ae-4044-aa4e-e667b1704a1c.md)

## methods that are definitely for programming

- [FLOC Estimation](19e7e65f-c8d6-4948-a4b2-a2c9dc61f65c.md)
- [Evergreen Targeting](9e02b7d8-579c-43f7-b7bd-1847af3d48bf.md)
  - [Best Practices for Modern ES Projects](594f5a88-fda2-4a09-aebf-066c7f0a3ff0.md)
- [Rethinking Release Channels / Versioning: The EARS Model](89875dc3-a8c9-4c07-85b1-92ce218f1a2b.md)
- [Markdown document loose structured data model](81a68a33-8873-4487-ae54-72b1db346d93.md)
  - TODO: link this in with other "Semantic Markdown" notes
- [3D Print Artifact Versioning](b65a21d3-ed3d-41ac-aa22-122d551404ce.md)
- [Identity Management Super-Best Practices](3f7019fb-74ea-4de9-bfb1-3985e0b79482.md)
  - (ie. practices so good, almost nobody is following them yet)
- [best practices for curlable Bash](5f356d79-5641-4a89-a9a2-dd48daa0b0f5.md)

## micro-methods / style guide components

- [complex manual of style / linting rules](4c14e226-026d-4b8c-a173-e26d0cce893a.md)
- [folding-style indentation/line continuation](7443de47-97a8-498a-81dd-61e007f7ec15.md)
- [In Praise of Modular Standards](0ca3ebf6-d337-4505-931c-dbf0dbab2a5e.md)

## less method, more schema

- [Schema State of the Art](48e198ea-05b3-44e3-b44b-9e6940a2076e.md)
- [ULID UUID compatibility](7961f8b3-8d57-44a3-8ff0-68fa609e7392.md)
- [spec brainstorms](623663c5-9130-48ca-a3a7-1a37e88d307a.md) is more concretely about data structures and the like: lower-level stuff than what's on this page.
- [alternatives to white/blacklist](7c56caa2-4827-4e81-8819-bf46c927d434.md)

## somewhere else around this method lab

should probably be added to a few more pages:

- [drag screw rotate zoom/unzoom](401bb618-4c91-4344-9887-bb37e14cabf6.md)

## other end of the spectrum

- this page [ought to be merged with specs laws](2c64b439-a25a-43ab-aa22-b79014d8fd44.md), once I remermber where I put it

## See Also

- [xxiivv](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#about), which are like "this, but polished"
- fitting in with this might be my series/whatever around [Dynamicland](3b266f40-6aa4-4659-a774-3cf5a95c8dfc.md) and the last of the weird mutant laboratories
