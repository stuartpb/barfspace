# Getting the upstream sources

I get the feeling this mainline kernel isn't going to be compatible with my device

Googling for "mediatek kernel source" and "alco kernel source" (and `MTK_CUSTOM_ROOT`, a string found by reading references to Mediatek's source trees) turns up some links suggesting it's gonna be tough:

- https://www.change.org/p/mediatek-inc-release-kernel-sources-for-android-mediatek-socs-and-comply-with-the-gpl
- https://techrad.io/news/1581/mediatek-wont-release-its-source-code-but-why/
- https://www.xda-developers.com/mediatek-android-one-source/
- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41800798/does-mtk-share-their-aosp-source-code-how-can-i-get-it

I found a couple references to building from Mediatek source trees:

- https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2754513
  - https://appuals.com/build-mediatek-android-kernal-source/ which seems to be plagiarized, at least in part, from that post (shared typos etc)

And some other kernel trees:

## asking for it

[this XDA post](https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=69370058&postcount=155) describes the poster asking Alco for their kernel source
