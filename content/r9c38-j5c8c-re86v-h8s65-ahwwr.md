# The Uncle/Nephew Hierarchy Model Characteristic

this is a kind of hierarchy you see in the world that I don't know if there's no name for it

I'm putting this under the Oozy Sewer even though the nature of Bagtent makes this pretty much irrelevant (you'd have to define "siblings" and "parents")

but it's when, okay, so, the example I had, say you have a folder of files that behave one way, and that folder also has a few subfolders whwere the files behave a different way

(specifically this was for a proposal I made for the authorized-keys daemon CoreOS is building circa mid-2020; I commented on a GitHub issue with it a few days ago, you can find it something like that)

those files aren't "siblings", they're "nephews"
