# The 3D Window Sidecar / Metaphor / Interface

split out from [Talkboy Wand / App](04xss-vzy0e-ed9cg-c1sbs-q6em4)

actually, with the Gyro, this could legitimately be an amazing 3D navigation tool: let the user pan around a 3D canvas...

I guess you can do that with a phone too, pretty much, huh? one of the things I was thinking was "each side can be a different action!" but each side of a phone can be a different function.

damn, why am I not using AR Mode like this to do OpenSCAD camera work?

I keep thinking "But you only have 3DOF!" but it's like, okay, use the screen for the other two, and pinch for the third. Let 3-Finger Pinch be the "actually rescale the model" gesture - 2-finger pinch just means "GET OVER HERE", as the "go forward" gesture
