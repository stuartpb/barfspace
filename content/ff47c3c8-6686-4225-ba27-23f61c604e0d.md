## The rest of The Rest

[Loose Notes][], which I might swap with this page, actually, where this page (at that UUID) can be a meta mood-board topic page thing about [appendices][]

See also the further plan / thoughts I just wrote up around all this on [Vertigo][]

## wait what the hell was I thinking

***No index page for pages that don't have a proper index?!***

I guess the idea is that here's what be best:

- A page for "this page would be in a category of its own, if we had more pages" stuff
  - Most of the things that can't be easily described in those terms should live over in the tumbly wing or around Musings
  - This would basically be what "The Rest" is right now
- Loose Notes, at the very end
  - maybe we'll just put our finger on the scale for that
  - or maybe we'll just suck it up and use random UUIDs like they're random and opaque like a gentleman
- A page for Appendices and Indices in General
- A Best Of page
- The plans page
