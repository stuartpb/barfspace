Well, that's neat

## WASM

It supports WASM, right? [yes](https://deno.land/std/manual.md#wasm-support)

What about WASI?

Isn't there another thing that was doing WASI? wasmtime / wasmer? Could these projects be altered to be compatible?

## native plugins

I can't quite tell how native packages are supposed to work? I guess https://deno.land/x/plugin_prepare/ is how? (found via https://deno.land/x/webview/plugin.ts)

looks like the API is [up in the air](https://deno.land/typedoc/index.html#openplugin)
