This is so much easier than the Logitech software, OMG

For some reason - it looks like Profile 2 was my "Shift and Control" set? And they're in as "LEFTSHIFT DOWN, RESERVED UP/DOWN, LEFTSHIFT UP" instead of just "LEFTSHIFT UP/DOWN"

Anyway, I've changed it to just "key down" and...

Well, it seems like none of the macros I'm setting are taking effect?

whatever, I'm due to ditch this mouse in a couple days anyway
