> I need to sleep right now, maybe this'll turn into something, the way all crappy crap-fields become kingdoms (see: Linux, Git, Wikipedia, Python 2, Perl 5, the web) and all beautiful shrines become ashes and ghosts (see: MULTICS, HURD, Python 3, Perl 6, vaporware in general).

I think about this a lot

like, not just what was described in [The Rise of Worse Is Better][], which is, you know, *good* and all, and right, but, like... Jodorowsky's Dune, and lots of other wide-open-too-ambitious projects, versus, like, Velvet Underground. The [Wikipedia article on Worse is Better](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better) doesn't cover its applications *outside of code*, how, at a higher level, freeing yourself from perfectionism is how you get something out there that catches on.

I don't know, maybe I just haven't been appreciating the original Worse is Better philosophy enough.

okay so the line that - and I'm not talking about the non-software implications of WiB, I don't think - the thing that successive essays like http://dreamsongs.com/Files/worse-is-worse.pdf (I'm reading it now) fail to grasp is that *implementation simplicity* is something Donald Norman praised (so, *so* rightly) in *The Design of Everyday Things* - *this* is why WiB's key tenet, that implementation simplicity should be the most important thing, is right.

anyway that's a thing for meditations I guess, though it's also spilling into the SAFER methodology, like the "s" should really be "simple" instead of "sustainable"

the thing I'm thinking is the thing I'm in alignment with the article on:

> portable, will be accepted more quickly if good enough, will be eventually improved, and will, generally,
