The above excerpt from https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/03/11/requiem-for-a-dream might be the most penetrative description of how I feel when I think about telling someone about how reading and/or thinking about Aaron Swartz makes me feel. I have no basis talking about someone I never met, never recognized until it was too late, until I've demonstrated that I can accomplish something that could even remotely justify the interest.

Under http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/theoryofchange, that is what I'm currently working at.
