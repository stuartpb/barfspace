This is a concept node, so the text below should be split off into smaller thought pages.

## Iterations / Incarnations

- [oldest iteration](11fe7abc-8d2c-44a9-8785-04f94ef0398c.md)
  - this was more when I was thinking I would invent my own IDE implementation
    - like, "with an option to use c9 instead if you need something the core IDE isn't good at"
  - Theia and code-server were not even remotely on the radar
    - remote servers and virtual machines were, though
- [First Agnostic](d4a9a963-a67c-461c-a5e5-c5dce43e64c1.md)
  - I'd say this is sort of where my vision is centered, ultimately?
    - However, "Workspace Pod Manager" is in a scope I can feasibly intend to operate within at the moment
    - Ultimately, I think this serves as a kind of "end goal"
      - like, models in the Workspace Manager iteration ought to be designed to not conflict with it
  - [Windowsystem/"Frame" Splitting Model](a7e4f6dd-3cb1-4378-a1ea-bfc558098f87.md)
    - sort of a dying gasp of interoperability with the "make my own IDE" conceptualization
  - [lost thought on connecting frontend to backend](a73720c1-395f-47fc-aed0-80a1f3a24db5.md)
- [Workspace Pod Manager for Kubernetes](31201498-292d-4923-ab42-d5ee9c2d5a08.md)
