# Collaborative/Collective Content Containers

This is a hub for [project seed ideas](gm4xd-ehwvm-ca85t-mmsg2-4ptqf) I have that are like a wiki or forum or whatever.

Some of them may fall under [My Old Bad Ideas](yfsxd-ek388-ct9ye-xb9we-qb9mj), and may be accomplishable with [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) in some fashion

in rough order of message-versus-medium-oriented nature of the idea (from message to medium):

- [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) itself is a kind of container
- [Clipsnail](xbfst-wkmeg-g1aw2-09fs6-txv4j)
- [timetress](1xy0t-xh1y2-phaxm-6r2g1-2jcws)
- [Universal Issue Tracker](2c2tv-easmw-csakz-gdvve-r080m)
- [DingRoll](gpewp-hm9hh-mgasb-8apy4-d0142)
- [Squorum (boxesin redux)](g3018-t2t29-4p91w-34nep-jb4ap)
  - [Red String Room](rgvet-f9pds-01985-jef45-ywyew)
    - another instance of "here's the version of this project if Bagtent ate it"
    - Not strictly Bagtent-specific, though
      - though bagtent works best / with the most necessity for it
- [Toot Galaxy](2n3q9-nvnnv-32acx-ydakc-p8bj5)
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline](mhmrc-a1fqb-8m9yc-bjq3m-ph145)
- [Casettic](d2xmj-z49kx-e580m-s0t4n-8phrb), the Sparse File in the Sky
  - this can also be thought of like a one-dimensional Squorum with stricter scarcity
- Clubs, an event aggregator and incubator
- [passback](z7606-aq758-m38gk-3kme7-v0r0t)

## sort of like this

- [editor-related concepts](aamhr-wg63b-cf806-5kx1h-n3g6n) tend to tackle tools that could be used for stuff like some of the above (especially when structed as bagtent) from a single-user point of view
- [concepts for communities](sfwb4-37xeb-42aag-wn5r2-6s2av) is specifically oriented around the orgs, with the shared content base as a usually-secondary concern
  - the Network Neighborhood quests linked from there sometimes go here, but are mostly closer to there

## possible litmus test for this page vs. Community Wishlist

Can it be instanced, or is there only one reasonable application of this tool to a community?
