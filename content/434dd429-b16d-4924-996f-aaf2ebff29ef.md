# Barfspace Department of Parks and Recreation Vistor's Center!

This page is supposed to be, like, a friendly, gentler version of me trying to explain just what in the all hell is going on around here, like a little tour, I guess. Part of the whole general [Improvement District][RCID] plan going around, I guess.

Well, it's not easy to explain, you know that? You want to hear what it sounds like when someone just goes and tries to *explain what barfspace is*, you go and take a look at [the Meta section of the library][barfmeta].

It's a mess. That's the *real* answer to what barfspace is that'll *always* be accurate: "it's a mess." But, you want to have a chance to understand *specifically* what that mess is, you go around and you look at some of these pages here. These are the pages that'll show you...

## The Best of the Mess, the Last Time I Was Thinkin' About It

*NOTE: This is probably going to turn into my "hot stack" of stuff I'm currently working on. So be it.*

## Oh, This Ain't a Page Proper, But...

Watch your head as you go around the town right now - there's a *mighty* wind of change a-blowin' through, and they're currently lookin' to take this old-timey frontier town into a whole hootin' and hollerin' big city of all the stuff Stuart P. Bentley's ever tried to write, but never finished. They're gonna merge us with a city called [Lean Notes][]! And then we're gonna be renamed altogether, moved over to some kind of "sub-domain" at notes.stuartpb.com! Imagine that!

Also, who the hell talks like this except those people from the frontier village in South Park where it's perpetually 1864?

Oh, also, [Wigfield][]. Big influence on the whole project.
