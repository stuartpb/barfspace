# Cormanism

Other examples when I was originally trying to pad out [CBGBism](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md):

- Linux
- Craigslist
- Rolling Stone (re Hunter S. Thompson, etc)
- Roger Corman films, for learning the ropes of Hollywood

What many (if not most) of these flashpoints had in common was a very low barrier to entry - Roger Corman was known for hiring just about anybody. And that means, yes, his films are full of a lot of no-talent nobodies - right alongside Sylvester Stallone, Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard...

It's not quite the same as CBGB, though, in that the movement didn't merely nucleate in these before exploding.
