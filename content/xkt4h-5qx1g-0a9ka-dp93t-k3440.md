# Netlify's identity stuff

forked off from [the notes on Netlify CMS](peejv-w0xm5-ry9kg-z2x2s-bxtw5) so it can go into [Identity Notes](cjjjj-8ccj8-6va1s-8p856-cjv8r)

https://github.com/netlify/gotrue says it's based on OAuth2 and JWT

There's also this [Git Gateway](https://www.netlify.com/docs/git-gateway/) stuff
