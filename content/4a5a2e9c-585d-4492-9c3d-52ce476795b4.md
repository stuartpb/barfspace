# DUE DATE: 2020-01-20

I'm making a commitment here to remember this tweet from January 21, 2019: https://twitter.com/FanSince09/status/1087451258137399296

> Jawn Wudders @FanSince09 Retweeted Mother Jones
>
> Martin Luther King Jr. was a pretty good public speaker, but what if he’d delivered his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech with a comically exaggerated italian accent?

>> Martin Luther King Jr. was a pretty good public speaker, but what if he’d delivered his 1963 “I Have a Dream” speech with the aid of Microsoft PowerPoint? https://www.motherjones.com/media/2011/01/martin-luther-king-powerpoint/

I posted a quick riff on this, and then, after a moment, continued:

> Stuart P. Bentley @stuartpb Replying to @stuartpb @FanSince09
> In fact, you know what, that Mother Jones gag has me pissed off enough that I'm going to add this to my stack of writing prompts. I've got a lot of other stuff on my plate, but I'm gonna start reaching out to my I-talian brethren, and I'll see y'all on January 21, 2020.

At which point, I remembered that MLK Day doesn't work like that, it's fixed to a day of the week like Thanksgiving (meaning it will be on January *20*, 2020), so I promptly backed my words up to this note and deleted them from Twitter.

I've pinned this to a prominent position in my notes tree, and intend to keep working on this idea off and on over the course of the next year. Watch this space.
