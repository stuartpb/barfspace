# Pluskube "Ops in a Box" Hub

concept hub for "what if we flipped the script on cloud services by letting people buy them off the shelf"

The current model is [kateskit](ebf47d2a-8719-4d66-80cd-dbbabaf98165.md)

- There really ought to be a page for "live infrastructure that could support this" (like, close to the Clusterhood hub, but separate?)
  - That page can encapsulate [this name-system concept](1454b17b-f196-4d2c-88dd-062f8ba59298.md)
  - Also, a "serial key" concept, where you get a lifetime subscription for buying one, and it's the one unique component to the out-of-box installation, and it's backed up to a physical key/label in case you wipe the whole system, but it's also a secret (ie. public stuff is a "discovery hash" of it or something like that) that, if you share it, you're giving anyone access to
    - There should probably be a "register" function that sets it up so we'll email you if anything happens, and once you've confirmed an email address you can't remove it for six months unless you confirm the removal by clicking a validation link from that address (so I can't steal a leaked ID by kicking the owner off of it)
      - This is also for "we kicked you out of the system because you abused our ToS, please contact us if you fix the problem and we'll see what we can do / if we trust you or whatever"

I've moved the ramble that originally lived here to [The Modern Personal Computer](28ace726-6e7d-4306-a0b4-83b4790ac961.md) to illustrate what I'm going for

## GitOps

that seems like an important term to include in all this, or at least the, you know, dev parts

## MOVEME

[this nginx-replacement idea](3ba479f7-3be4-41bf-a017-65edd4879c55.md) is based around the old Dorku model that I'm coming back around to
