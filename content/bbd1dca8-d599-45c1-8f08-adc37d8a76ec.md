# Infrastructure Project Ideas

These are ideas for services that would help facilitate other projects

The [top-level project idea list](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) has a lot of other kinds of projects that could be seen as "infrastructure" (Frameworks, Components, Methods...) that aren't the kind of infrastructure I'm talking about here

- [A local-Let's-Encrypt-certificate-provisioning service](af61f26f-4813-4473-9550-cc038de75965.md)
- [Parked Project (Redux)](416491ee-4b52-4887-96f0-465f361a36ea.md)
- itself.co
- [Quadration](0d93d812-6739-4142-9e16-d686e6df00ef.md)

## honorable mention

- [plushu](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md) would probably be useful for all of the above
