# studeku problem core

## game papercuts

- Link's Awakening DX ROM appears to be in French?

## system papercuts

- the menu that the Waveshare image had isn't present in the PinkyPiX one
- wow, it comes with .bash_history. hacky. probably has pregenerated ssh keys too if this is how it was put together

## case issues

- the volume knob is t r a s h
- screen isn't centered, so the right edge gets cut off
- feel like it'd be cooler if the case didn't use screws
  - at the very least, it shouldn't require its own. a good case would work around the existing screw assembly
  - but a better case would replace the spacers altogether
- no HDMI or data USB (ie OTG) access
- haven't tried the dpad thing yet
