# back on stuquart

yadda yadda

uninstalled pdanet

## torrent and drivers

tested, and mic didn't work, so I needed to install the HD Audio Driver from MediaTek

neither Realtek nor a mirror had a good download speed, so I installed qBittorrent (out of curiosity to see if it was nicer than Deluge)

the mirror had a torrent, and that downloaded faster. I'll do a checksum comparison with the official source later

## features

wanted to install WSL

didn't see it in features, did enable "Graphics Tools" and SSH server tho

## update madness

see Twitter thread (up to date / you should update, assistant, can't install to usb)

## de-portableifying this

going to `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control` per online tutorials about this and setting the `PortableOperatingSystem` value to 0

[(side musing spliced off)](36b96f1d-7022-4613-abb1-14af8ba5c25a.md)

hitting "Try Again" because I don't want to reboot if I don't have to

It took a very long time, but it did eventually finish updating. Needed a few restarts

## stuzzy boot tweak

Hitting ESC at boot, deleted "Windows Boot Manager" that got installed to my UEFI
