# a fleet of encrypted MicroSD cards

this is the Shadow Curtain concept I'm currently looking at: keeping a bunch of MicroSD cards in a little thing attached to my phone, some of which sync to encrypted data on the pwnagotchi

these could all, like Ceph, use some kind of partition identifier that identifies them as an encrypted volume, so they automatically prompt to unlock when inserted

- secrets
  - for passwords, password hints, things like that
- shadow
  - for the Anarchist Cookbook and other tech research that'd constitute "reasonable suspicion"
  - stuff here would still be "shared underground"
- turndown
  - for thuoghts that re just too dark n twistd for public consumption :smiling_imp:
- intel
  - for dossiers, Circus Rosa, BIGDOG stuff
  - might overlap with Shadow?

These could also maybe be kept in different trinkets: one in a locket, one in a secret panel of a table, one in a ring (maybe always in a USB reader, like a drive) etc.

In fact, the "data ring" approach is a pretty sweet idea

## also

Maybe these can be for "security levels": like, the "most secure disk" contains the `secret`, `intel`, *AND* `shadow` notebooks, so I don't need to swap just to save a new password hint in the middle of an op (this would be facilitated by syncing to the pwnagotchi)

We could also have multiple levels of secrecy: like, maybe the "most secure level", on the Pwnagotchi, needs to be decrypted beyond the "at rest" level
