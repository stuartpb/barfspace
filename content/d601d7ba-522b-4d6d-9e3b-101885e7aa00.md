### the closest I come to a counterpoint

- [The Bloated Age](a55b7efe-20ab-4cb1-a3ae-56f774619575.md) is all about holding this revulsion in its full magnitude, while also considering the full implications of the notion that, if humanity's going to make it through all this, we're never going to see anything like it again.

## DSA.FYI: The Cutting Room Floor

Pardon our [dust][and echoes].

This content may eventually get put back somewhere within https://DSA.FYI/ proper: until then, they live in my notes.

[and echoes]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V8NmynhfeUs

This'll be where I stash stuff I decide the report needs to cut to be more cohesive. (Previously, it was pretty much "just throw everything in, the longer it is the less likely the people that it describes are to read it, and the funnier this gets")

- this list is where I'd put items if I didn't feel like just dropping DSA.FYI altogether for now

## just random thoughts

in the cost breakdown for making a thing where you're including value for the time, labor and energy of the people who made it, "profit" is basically the line item for "fuck you"

reading about [mutualism][], specifically critique of it, I'm seeing this concept of "labor vouchers", and, like, it kind of boils down to Whuffie for me. We shouldn't deny anybody food or healthcare so there's that function of money cut down, so if other things are predicated on a pledge based on reputation, why not have a system of hierarchically-recognized self-reported time spent on labor connected with its material products? that seems like the closest thing to how functional societies delegate scarce resources that I've seen
