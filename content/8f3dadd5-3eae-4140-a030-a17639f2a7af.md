# PICO-8 2048x2048 Visible Mondo Megacartridge

Like, instead of supporting an insanely-large space, you support... like a spritesheet's worth of pixels, but each pixel is a cartridge, or something like that, I don't know

This definitely overlaps with my "PICO-8 Extremely Extended Address Space Modem" idea

Also overlaps with Dataturf/Casettic, as that did.
