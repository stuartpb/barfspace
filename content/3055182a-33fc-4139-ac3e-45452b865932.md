# more mucking with the Firefox graphics stack

Continuing the changes I made [at the beginning of the month (August 2019)](3c1b4aa4-0c92-4207-abb9-12dbc5c7ce2e.md), having [improved my graphics stack about a week later](b17093a0-4c3f-4740-a4ee-1b51167e55f7.md)

Unsetting `layers.acceleration.force-enabled` and setting `gfx.webrender.enabled` to `true` instead

UPDATE: I was getting a lot of Firefox freezes and seeing the GPU get REALLY hot - not sure if this is all related, but I've decided to set `gfx.webrender.enabled` back to `false` for now. If the tearing becomes an issue again, I might try re-enabling it.

UPDATE 2019-09-03: the tearing was an issue again, so I've gone ahead and enabled *both* settings - that might have a different effect?
