reminder that all my ideas around this live in [3D Printer Upgrades](1d4w1-vdk4w-058f7-jserp-knwpn) right now

## Socks

Stuff like [these](https://e3d-online.com/v6-socks-pro-pack-of-3)

These prevent prints from failing by way of the plastic collecting all over your print head. It's a really good idea.

On the other hand, they get in the way of cooling, which can have its own set of problems. (IIRC there's a thing about this in the Upgrades - bigger fan spout or whatever.)
