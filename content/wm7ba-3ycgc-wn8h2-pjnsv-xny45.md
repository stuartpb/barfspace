# The Shadow Curtain

This is meant to be the page tracking and alluding to repositories of content that is kept foreign to these notes.

[BISNES/BIGDOG](qzdfm-gv3h5-r1a62-4edk3-8qw53) and [Federating Bagtent](nfwjw-tvvm0-gkb2e-k3xhv-h6f7k) both explore the concept of tooling for Random Markdown Graphs that may need to interoperate with different levels of confidentiality

It crosscuts a lot of [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) concerns

## reflections in motion

public notes on my internal noteball [here](wxcet-dc8mq-cy93f-n27t6-vd70w)

## Purpose

- [Bulletin on Problematic Content in Public Notes](99d2x-72rbn-4j9rf-ajss3-pf5cm)
- [The Role of the News Page](8hmvx-jty19-mwap1-c9mzk-5aq0a)
  - Touches on the limitations of what my public notes can hold
  - Clearly delineates how my "three core personal notebooks" would be factored
- [Softly Encrypting Secret Content](vrwwb-7bgj7-gm89z-ww4q7-et42n)
  - This describes an implementation for secrecy / encryption that also has a clear use model
  - It follows from the concept from the Role of the News Page notes
- [Spec for codebooks et al](3jsfb-r27p8-jwa3j-1p5bx-0z0gz)
- [Encrypting a whole repo for a secret noteball](05rhg-9te1j-f2aah-jk2z5-qk8y6)
- [Encrypted MicroSD Card Fleet](3tckh-7vans-p39fc-2x8fs-trh08)

## More thoughts on keeping a private repo synced

- [Mostly by running a Git server or something like that on a Raspberry Pi](h9tj4-xrdjc-mdamq-yqk76-effm5)
  - [Thoughts on storing private content on an on-person IoT Git server](hvjcw-eyqqh-rhafq-wh7a2-7qwph)

## rehosted note from Loose Notes

[Blackbeard's Treasure](8z894-g3abt-an9je-erjxy-kqcm2) public/private/secret three-layer personal disclosure classification model?

On this note, these linked pages should consider having a "confidential but not encrypted" host, versus a host/toolchain for encrypted database(s) that could be kept in secret locations (this might be a job for secure scuttlebutt? maybe not necessary for one user)

## Implementation

The rest of this page is working with [The Notestack Core of Engineers](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) to figure out how these priorities intersect with the Outstanding Challenges there

## Brainstorming "quest"

Taken from the only Barfspace Quest that was moved to the Operations page (the one where the Divisions are listed now) and not later rearranged to be under [Operation Trapper Keeper](3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca):

- [ ] Set up a private bagtent tree for notes that should remain unpublished and private.
  - [ ] Figure out what'd be an appropriate way to distribute this.
    - [ ] Keep a master repository in an encrypted repo on a USB stick on your router-server?
      - [ ] Complete the "Flash Open-Source Router Firmware" quest (which I don't think I've written up yet) to unlock this path.
    - [ ] Keep it on your desktop, and just try to keep it booted into Linux forever?
      - [ ] Unlock the "Booting Stutendo Under Stushiba" tech to make this a more feasible idea.
