# stushiba plans

## possible future changes

- [installing scilab](e735aceb-e2f5-4e00-91bc-4024c17d3365.md) for a gig

## Miscellaneous thoughts

- Add microcode updates for AMD
- How hard can I make rEFInd be the default boot option? Can I clobber the default location without breaking Windows boot?
  - Not sure how old this note is, because rEFInd has been working at boot for a while now
- the GNOME Screen Keyboard is *hella broken* (should check how it looks on stuzzy)
- What's with the Deepin greeter? Didn't I set my default greeter to be GTK? Do I need to uninstall Deepin?
  - I think I installed Deepin a while back (it's 2019-06-08 now)? Don't think I have a deepin greeter problem any more
