# Lean Notes

This was the root node of the first [bagtent][] repo collecting all my thoughts on best practices and how-to guides for pursuing any sort of project or idea, whether it be a book, or a Web app, or a board game, or a 3D model, or a screenplay, or a microchip, or an essay, or a robot, or a logo, or whatever.

I haven't really messed with this page yet, so a lot of it is just stuff that should be merged over there.

One of the things I struggle with is *organizing* these thoughts, so I've just dropped them into a big unordered bag called `content/`, and will describe the ways to browse through them below.

## History

This repository, in its current state, is a mix of a few different projects I've started in the past:

### The original Lean Notes series (first drafted on Trello)

I had a series of cards on a collection of Trello boards that I was using to mock up something : https://trello.com/leannotes

Back on January 18, I decided that, for accessibility's sake (and growing increasingly wary of Trello since its acquisition by Atlassian), I'd rather have these notes written as Markdown essays on GitHub (for easy replication to anywhere else Git is supported).

At the point in September 2018 when I merged these other projects below into this repo (and refactored it into files by UUID in the process)

But even when it came to the original boards on Trello, some chapters had little to no content beyond a title and a summary. Some Previous / Read On lists will lead off in directions that don't make any sense. Some sections may just link off to a GitHub Issue for details instead of having something written in the text itself (and *that* issue may have nothing in it).

See [issue #1](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/1) for more information on the process of migrating these to GitHub; file a new issue if there's something specific missing that you'd want to know, and I'll answer if I can.

Even when it was on Trello, I was experimenting with *multiple* Tables of Contents, sorting by different criteria:

- [The first one ("Table A")][Table A] is the general "order" you might want to go through if reading "cover to cover". It presents things in a somewhat interleaved fashion, explaining ecosystem between mechanics, things like that. It's well paced, but somewhat non-linear.
- [The second one ("Table B")][Table B] is sorted by scope. It's more "linear" and "focused", but more stratified: "learning" isn't as mixed with "doing". Table A links to all the content that was on boards in Lean Notes, but Table B doesn't have a place for all of them.

In the merged version of this repository, these Tables have been kept, and may be developed out to incorporate content from some of these other projects, or integrated into some larger "index documents " that may link to them as part of a larger-scope guide.

There's also [this board][The Dark Side], which I think I never put on either Table, because it's more like an Appendix.

There's also [this page listing all the tags][Tag readme] that doesn't *explain* them (yet), but it does give attibution for them.

### The how-i-roll repository

This was another, similar project to Lean Notes, but with more of an eye toward describing my own *specific* procedures I follow when setting out to do things. It contained three significant files, all of which fall under the category of "[Stuff I Do in my Projects on GitHub][]".
