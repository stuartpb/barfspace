# Federating and Distributing Trees like These Notes

This is a subproject of the [Engineering Core](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) for the Federated World of [Smuggler's Code](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md)

## A thought from revamping Messays

I was remarking on how I could want to do something like TVTropes' Laconic wiki, and then I realized that that can be a concept "forking" an existing bagtent wiki's symbols: to make alternate versions of the same content with a different "tone" or whatever - a differnt tree using the same symbols forms a different "namespace"

## Modeling Collaboration and Contribution

Pages considering what'd be needed to start federating:

- [The Shadow Curtain](e50eb50f-cc83-43b5-888a-d2ae77daf8a5.md)
  - the (ambiguous) secret society branched from the [Notestack Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md)
  - Considering the tooling considerations of a single user spanning public and private content
- [A true Gossip Wiki (BISNES/BIGDOG)](bfdafa43-6389-46c1-a308-8e6cc68bf0a3.md)
