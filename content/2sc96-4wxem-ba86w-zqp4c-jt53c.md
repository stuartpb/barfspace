# Possible Writing the Ship mechanic: Next Night / Season Draw Table

So my idea here is that you'd have cards for behind-the-scenes twists / directions (like "audiences love all but one of your main characters")

are these maybe The Memos, ie. they're maybe from the Executives, as ratings reports, or staff announcements, or just whims of their bosses / their kids / some guy on YouTube the EP thought sounded pretty smart

while when players write / draw, they are roleplaying executives, once the season starts, they're the writers / directors / actors, so pick with that in mind.

the backs of the cards would hint at the nature of the twist (eg. the previous example might have "audience reaction" on it or something like that) - these are maybe the subject lines of the memos?

maybe a "season" is defined by whenever a player throws out the first card, this signals that the season is drawing to a close - the season will close once six cards have been laid down (so a "season" can be a night, or a week, or an entire film's production in a long-running series - it's more like a "scene" in Fiasco)

more-elaborate twists, with background and stuff, can cite reference material for deeper explanation, like a page in an accompanying guidebook (like Betrayal at House on the Hill's), or a page online. It's just that the card should strive to be *usable* on its own, in its own space. (maybe that means they need to be jumbo cards?)

you can have, say, X draw piles for X number of players? or maybe always three? maybe base it on how many cards you have in your overall deck?

you can have as many cards in your hand as you want / can draw any time, but you can't draw if you have more than anybody else

choosing to create a new card counts like drawing a card from an all-new pile, so all draw restrictions still apply.

you can throw out cards into your own personal outbox, where anybody else can take them, but you can't get them back until the deck reshuffles

once a season has had six cards put down, it is closing: players can add any last-second wish twists to the table. the table locks once the number of cards on it is divisible by 6: players can withdraw cards (any that were placed on the table, or just from the incomplete row? I think the former) in addition to adding cards to make that happen (maybe they have to withdraw to their outbox?)
