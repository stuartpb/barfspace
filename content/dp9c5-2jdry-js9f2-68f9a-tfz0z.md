# Disney SDET application / cover letter

(riding off [other content prepped for Disney jobs](7k0cp-skb5r-k788a-egy0s-xpzez))

## content

I believe I would be an excellent candidate for this position. I've been doing QA professionally since I was 15, and have been coding with JavaScript since 2012. I have an understanding of web technologies thorough enough that I have caught bugs in browsers' own implementations of them (which were then fixed). I'm constantly uncovering edge cases in the systems I interact with, like entering passwords over an unspecified maximum length, or containing spaces, or consisting entirely of spaces. (I think I might have even run into one of these issues on the Disney Parks site in the past, though I didn't file an issue for it at the time.)

Of all the places I could apply, I really, really want to work for Disney. I've taken regular trips to Walt Disney World since as far back as I can remember, back when Innoventions and Test Track were still Communicore and World of Motion. Going back to Walt's original vision of an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, I think the Disney Parks are marvels of modern engineering. I've played Sorcerors of the Magic Kingdom, I've read the NFC tag on my MagicBand, and I've worked with the Fastpass+ system. I would love to contribute to this ecosystem.
