had to reduce `$fn` to get it to slice without missing bits

drive gear nut slipped off, causing squeaking and only incidental extrusion

(found it inside the extruder attached to the vestigial magnet)

## status

the extruder made a real screwy clicking / rattling when turning while empty. after taking the idler door off after the second full-multi print, found a chunk of melted filament wisps hanging out in there which seems to have been the culprit
