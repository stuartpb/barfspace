# Open Platform All the Things

A thing I think about sometimes is that any sufficiently-genericized technology should have an open-source base that that hardware can be built from.

See also the SACRED properties, for what these initiatives would focus on

- [Drones](cd719be0-5b7c-4263-accf-cf6cddb2a16b.md)
  - There's already open software platforms - just extend that to hardware
- [Mice / input peripherals](2a8c1374-646c-411b-a6c8-205dbef84dbc.md)
- [RISC-V](35027518-3f14-463d-aa87-d2fd124c6bd5.md) - ultimately, even the chips should be open
