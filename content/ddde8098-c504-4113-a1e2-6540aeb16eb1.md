# How Thought Turns Into Notes Here

I'm gonna see if I can get this page to be the standing center for reflecting on "current state" versus "plans" and "recent developments" - this is something that tends to send me spinning in the [metaquiddity][] vortex, so I tend to get... rambly.

For ways I've gathered my thoughts at points in the past, see [My Thought Collection Process Through the Ages](da311588-e9d8-4a56-898f-63934bcc0131.md)

A historic note on how this worked, or was supposed to work, at one point has been moved to [here](1d70b7d4-c95c-4ef0-a2a5-c1f94afca7fb.md).

## Modern reflection

My self-teaching [Study Journals](9403033b-a238-47d1-865b-4e1baa0f2577.md) are kind of a "raw feed" into the stuff that goes into these notes:

the [Method Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), where experimental best practices are drafted, is like the other pole, where experience is thoroughly condensed into whole frameworks.

Eventually, this content ought to re-emerge within [Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md)

## Other classes of record

There's another page on [Journaling and Checking In](74453d4a-1474-47d7-a813-cc39cf773bcc.md) under Wellness that covers the kind of stuff that I guess goes in News and Raw and Petlogs and the like?
