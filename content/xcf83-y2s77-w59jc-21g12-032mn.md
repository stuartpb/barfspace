# About the Department of Barfspace

The Department of Barfspace is the district of notes concerned with introspecting the structure of the notes, and acting on that introspection by reshaping to fit. (This is a constant dance we do.)

The index for this district is [here](mfrzq-ch8r8-wj9a3-bdbdx-ffkc4), which has become the proper "Department of Barfspace": this page is now dedicated to history and introspection.

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo](fyd6d-81rzj-g0892-971ke-k0dre).

If the meta concern you're looking for isn't here, you can check [the general Notes Meta Notes index](hhd1t-c4qv4-wn8bf-nps2x-5fcjs)

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests](dwjwz-5wex1-ge9ve-1w4ge-avg0g) was eventually divided up into three "domains" which have grown into their own separate entities:

One was "Operations". These were the quests dealing with revisions to the content of these notes: legacies, maintenance, upkeep, migration, things like that. That page has become the index for the Department.

The second was "Visions", which dealt with quests about explaining structure, coming up with new things to try, reflecting on the philosophy guiding this notes work, stuff like that. That page has graduated into becoming the [Academy of Barfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j).

The third was "Implementation", which became the [Notestack Core of Engineers](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma). That page and the [bagtent index](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) form all the notes on implementation and structure *around* the content of these notes that isn't particular to this content tree.
