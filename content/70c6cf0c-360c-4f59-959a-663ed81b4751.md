# Hashblot Brute-Force Mindsweeper

Maybe password guessing databases are community-sourced, and points are attributed based on pull requests

## Flags

"Flags" are how a user's score is gauged: each blot+password combo that is successfully entered and recalled is called a "flag"

The "back of the flag" can be a visual representation of the password hash, or even just the FNV-1 hash

Flags are saved publicly, any user can try to capture one of your flags

## Capturing

A capture phase starts with 1 minute on the clock and 12 blots to memorize.

You must pick a password entirely of (simple?) dictionary words.

Every time you enter a password that has already been predicted by a common formula, you lose five seconds.

To make it easier to type frantically, there's a "did you mean" if someone types something using a word that's not in the dictionary, and they can enter-enter to accept it or something like that

## Razing

If you enter a password that collides with a password someone has entered before, you'll be told as much after the game is over - if you can devise a formula that captures a broad enough swath of passwords, you can submit a pull request, and you'll be forever attributed for eliminating that many passwords from the game.

Of course, in the future, you'll never see those passwords again, but, you know, they were lousy so who cares

We have a policy of only accepting formulae that have a certain complexity-to-caught-password ratio

Your own passwords are not included in the razed total, obviously

## Upkeep

To maintain your flags, you need to re-enter their password

Maybe flags are hidden from upkeep for a week
