### design

possible three-skulls (on front and/or back/inside, to signify when it gets put on to the sash) plaque that gets added

- FASCISTS WIN IMMEDIATELY IF HITLER GETS THIS
- NOT HITLER OR FASCISTS WIN
- (SKULLS) GAME OVER WHEN GIVEN TO HITLER
  - that might be a little gauche
- maybe just have it be directed to Liberals only, "DO NOT LET HITLER HAVE THIS"?
  - "KEEP AWAY FROM HITLER"
    - maybe that at all times, but with "OR FASCISTS WIN IMMEDIATELY" as the addendum
    - IDK how much the game leans awy from this iconography, but this addendum could be on an eagle (to signify that fascism is now loaded in the chamber, so to speak)
    - maybe the same idea, but using the game's internal skull/snake/knife language in that same "background" way (ie. maybe it's on a scroll with a knife through it, or even just a knife)

you could have the chancellor buckle be a circle with a "C", the "KEEP AWAY" bit as a (let's say red-on-white) rectangle (maybe this can be the lower buckle? and the upper buckle can be "CHANCELLOR", maybe white-on-red), and the "or fascists win immediately" as an emergency-coded white-on-red-framed-with-a-white-border.

## President Hat Band

Maybe an actual one-perimeter band of PETG?

I'm thinking I might be able to cheat and use this as a wipe object...
