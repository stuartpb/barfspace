## anyway

I started writing a bit for Silicon Valley based on a gag I started doing in the huttj Slack: [Venture Capitalist Optimization](268d627c-9d31-4f83-9a46-cee4b859e2c7.md)

I also thought it could be cool to have a little scene in Mr. Robot explaining why fsociety would have *encrypted* E Corp's data instead of just *destroying* it, which itself has larger implications for the nature of disrupting capitalism: [The Key](952f9c8d-fccb-4768-a861-a07bbdf6cc94.md)

I've also had a thought about how the second half of Tomorrowland could have been written a lot better, and how there's a better production of that story, [just a dream away](984a0787-bd4f-4b17-9ae1-0c701fb55d29.md).

Actually, it's a lot like this pitch I'd been working on for a while: [Let's Talk Tommy](79bc9e10-20c9-4399-8710-6aecea123ef2.md)

An idea for another episode of Black Mirror: [Face to Faiths](a0976547-6125-4325-9df2-d2414ac033bd.md)

There's this whole other spec that had emerged for me, for Atlanta: [Live Performances Nightly](c283d42c-af1b-4f8c-8cfc-d88eb4e809e5.md)

I've also had this idea for how I'd want to approach a reboot of [Daredevil](1e507445-564d-4766-8028-72c34f1da075.md).

That same kind of thought process led to [The Batfather](52338376-2a3d-427a-9dc2-7f4f35ba013b.md).

Speaking of DC, I've also thought of a [Martian-Manhunter-oriented Justice League](30fcf2ad-4b00-40ee-9ea0-19207b07a063.md) pitch. (don't look it's bad)

I've also had thoughts going *way* back, about how I'd continue [Angel](d3e708f2-8f7e-42c0-8da0-3d73c3776e05.md).

And, by this point, you can imagine I've got a thing or two to say about the concept of [fanfiction](bd72f20b-397c-4908-9112-1a86e073c492.md)

At the end of the season where Dennis left It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I thought of a spec script for how I would address the question of his wanting to leave the past behind him, and the folly of doing so: [Mister Reynolds' Neighborhood](412ca4e1-f349-4af1-87b2-eb7eea820295.md)

Pitch for [Air Bud 7](d553f3fa-6cd8-4571-9d2d-79d30e64bfee.md).

started writing a scene for [Avenue 5](d0678958-aa22-4c87-a1d0-4c2ecbada381.md)
