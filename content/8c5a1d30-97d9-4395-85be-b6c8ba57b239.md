# Meta Notes

This page is a loose nexus for all the "meta" stuff in these notes, especially relating to [the old barfspace][]:

- the old [Barfspace Visitor's Center][Visit]
- The few loose reflections I moved to the "Meta-musings" subheading on [Meditations][] (as well as other meta-related musings listed there)
- [The Plan Plan][]
- The hub that is currently conglomerating [History][]
- [Circa-December-2018 dumping space for thoughts on the name "barfspace" for the seed incarnation of this project][name explainer]
- [Twitter DM about this repo to Gravis][cera]
- [How I wrote before notes.stuartpb.com][how-i-roll writing.md]

When the old Barfspace tree was dissolved, I started the **[How I'm Writing with bagtent][HIWWB]** page to hold some of my initial thoughts on this, but I got distracted and *forgot* about that page's vital importance, so I'm really only catching up on some of those thoughts now.

## Not on barfspace but crucial to understanding the idea
