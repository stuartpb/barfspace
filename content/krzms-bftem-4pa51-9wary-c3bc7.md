# proquint bit-oriented written alphabet

forked from [here](qfhxq-y45ye-mwavx-9tcn2-dg0wd )

and there'd be 16 consonants, and they'd be written in some form that corresponds to a square of 4 bits, in order

and a similar deal with the vowels, each's character corresponds to the "bits" of the vowel somehow

so like the "B" sound would be represented by an "O" (a round stroke through, all 4 bits are 0), and Z is "X" (a solid slash through all, all 4 bits are 1)

the "sides" would be represented as a "half x", ie. a rotating V (with the "strokes" going through the bits) - after typing the diagram below, I'm thinking they're maybe "double-stroked"

the "diagonals" are slashes

the ones with three ones would be rotating Ls? hmm, that would conflict with the Vs, and break the "parts of an X" metaphor

I guess "diagonal T" makes as much sense as anything (I mean, after typing the diagrams below, I guess it's a "Y")

the single-bits would be rotating Qs (the "tail" going where the one goes)

OK, so here's what I was describing above:

```
 B     D     F     G     H     J     K     L
/ \   X \   / \   \     / X   \ /     /   \ /
\ /   \ /   X /   /     \ /         /     /
/ \   \           \       /   \ /     /   \ /
\ X     \   / \   / \     \     \   / \   / \
 M     N     P     R     S     T     V     Z
```

This is meant to be an elision of a strict "gate" representation:

```
 B     D     F     G     H     J     K     L
/ \   \ \   / \   \ \   / /   \ /   / /   \ /
\ /   \ /   / /   / /   \ /   \ /   / /   / /

/ \   \ \   / \   \ \   / /   \ /   / /   \ /
\ \   \ \   / \   / \   \ \   \ \   / \   / \
 M     N     P     R     S     T     V     Z
```

what I described as "Q" would probably be drawn as a "C-", on reflection, like the power icon.

and then you'd probably have something like this to mark vowels:

```
A  I  O  U
   |     |
-
      |  |
```

names are often presented like this (using the example of "Mozaroni Zokap-pudij Dadonotu"):

```
MOZA ZOKAP DADO
RONI PUDIJ NOTU
```
