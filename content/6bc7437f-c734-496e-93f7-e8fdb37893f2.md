# Collecting Links and Putting them Somewhere

Here's a long-form analysis of the link-sharing pattern I'm indexing at [this root index][metalinks]

This is a thing I've been doing for a decade (and I'm hardly the only one - this is where basically every link-aggregation site came from, especially Fark), in various ways that have each fallen apart over time (Gravis termed it "The Scorched Earth Effect").

Here's the bit about this I used to have on [The Office of Construction Plans][TOCP]:

## Organizing and Expanding the Linkdump

I think the old Linkdump used to be an entire *notebook*, if not an entire tab... it was a big deal.

Right now, I think there's a single link in it? And it's a pretty one-off link, to be sure - but there are still useful ways to classify it (it's an *Internet Archive* link that I want to memorialize *in archived form*, for instance, that's at least worth a page. Could even cross-reference it with [unlinkable][], as a general "stashing shit as the Library of Alexandria burns down" repository). Anyway, I can still have a "crap, I don't know" runoff, but I think I could make up a *lot* of the content I've been wanting to stash, back through *Clipsnail*, in Linkdump form (I guess the original Linkdumps predate Clipsnail... wow, it feels so weird to be [so archaeological about my own past][xkcd 1360]).

anyway I think it can cover a lot of gaps that are currently being split between Chrome's very-much-dead Favorites browser and my Tabalanche history (the one it can supplant being, of course, my old Favorites).

Also, note on in case I do that whole flowchart for how I handle impulses: it might be worthwhile to write up how I've channeled my urge to share online content over the years
