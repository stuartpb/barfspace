# Studtop Mk I "and a half" Plans/Exploration

TODO: fish still-relevant plans out from [the first iteration](9ac503ed-a6d8-4fc3-996b-d1e94d18e139.md)

This isn't much of a Mark 2, since it's mostly just a reconfiguration of the same hardware

For the main difference, see [the Mark I, take 2 model: Recovery-First](97191518-e7e9-4a55-9962-69b7b6399f5b.md)

## Goals after this step

Had I been able to install K3OS successfully, my first changes would all be in the service of reaching a remake of [the Iteration-1 Notestack Household Workspace](67826054-ed26-41e6-80c9-5d677e6a8cba.md)

- kubeapps
  - I'll see how close I can get to installing each of the rest of these as Helm charts
- metallb
- kubernetes-dashboard
- household-system/household-dns
