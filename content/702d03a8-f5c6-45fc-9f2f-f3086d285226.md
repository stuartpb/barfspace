## a brief note on how OneNote inspired this note structure

I'm too tired to go into too much detail right now, but I abused the hell out of OneNote 2007's "Copy Link to This Page" in my old OneNote notebooks - to the point that the tabs were pretty much just a way of finding the "home page" for an idea, and I'd have to navigate to which note a thing was on by following links.

That core idea made its way into this notestack, and you still see the occasional glimmer of me wishing I could "pop a text box just off to the side" with "aside sections" and headings like that. I'm not sure the way I tackle it now isn't better, though: I think this is where the ["Borkflowy"](a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md) idea came in, to see if I could make a UI that was based in Bagtent but could still capture the essence of that "I'm gonna scrawl an unrelated idea in the margins of this idea and maybe copy-paste movie it somewhere else later".
