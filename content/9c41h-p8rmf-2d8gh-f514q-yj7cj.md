# Projects Off the Conventional Web Stack

Most of my extensions are designed to be used somewhere between the backend of a web server and the frontend of a web browser.

Here are some projects that would be software, but *not* stuff that fits neatly into the Web Platform.

For how everything else fits into the Web Stack, see [this alternative project page index](v4zpd-ca2ft-cr8nh-rmzd2-jqyrp).
