# stuff that would help make Hubs a lot more versatile

Just a simple dump / import of all (pinned) objects in the scene by URL, and stuff like the text of the object if it's placed text

other "copy everything pinned in this room" facilities would be cool, like a "download package with all assets" and "export scene configuration to Spoke"

but also "Copy pinned items"

## selection

multiple selection would be cool, especially with something like a "pin/unpin brush"

pin all / unpin all

"always pin my objects before quitting"
