# Former Garbage Content of an Abortive Right Now

This was part of an Operation-Trapper-Keeper-adjacent (OTK distances itself from this because it was such a botch) operation to recapture the spirit of stuartpb.plan in the early days of these notes (somewhere right around the start of Project Akira, maybe even a bit before its inception, leading in as a factor to the decision).

It ended up being redundant with the root note, essentially, though it has some worthwhile content, so I'm keeping it stashed here.

I'm repurposing Right Now's node for Anything New, Exciting or Different because what I'm using it for now is more in the spirit of how it was referenced originally.

Here's a nexus for a bunch of corners of the notes that might give you an idea of what I've been working on and how I've been doing:

There's [this page about Getting My Shit Together][GYST] that is currently sort of like my "cursor" for remembering what I'm planning / in the middle of or whatever on "maintenance" of these notes. Like a build journal or something, idk, it kind of happened organically.

[GYST]: 3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca

The [Quests][] index is kind of like a spread-out to-do notebook, though some of these "quests" have been abandoned for years. (Some might have become entirely irrelevant.)

[Quests]: dwjwz-5wex1-ge9ve-1w4ge-avg0g

The [self-improvement and wellness index][Self] covers what I'm getting up to personally and habitually.

[Self]: 423z3-ntnzb-cba98-01wkc-5f427

The [checkin list][checkins] has some pages where I'll sometimes just go off about things I'm feeling with how my life is at - these are probably the most clearly dated posts here (though the Get Your Shit Together page is getting addendums like that).

[checkins]: nz7tm-y7ffr-mya5t-gbbhx-bnxyq

My status on a bunch of [projects][] has a page, kind of: these might get separated into "current notes" and "standing notes" at some point, I don't know. It's never really been easy to separate the two notions, and everything temporal tends to be connected, so it probably finds its way into Checkins above.

[projects]: gm4xd-ehwvm-ca85t-mmsg2-4ptqf

There's also a new page for [Learning Journeys][], which is kind of like for experimentation in a pre-project phase (which is admittedly rare for me, as I usually learn by choosing a project to pursue pretty quickly).

[Learning Journeys]: jg1g6-ex272-0h8cp-te3en-0y9cq

There's also a page on [what I'm wearing these days][Loadout].

[Loadout]: v75m1-h5gr2-g499k-2g6fe-s65rq
