# SUGGESTRON

This is a clearer re-imagining of [Gullibot](dwet6-czjp9-pja2r-w4q6e-vge7m)'s mechanics

You have a general "pool of facts" that players can pull from for either category (if they can figure out a way to implement it in the world/story)

But so, Suggestron has sensors that collect facts about the world around it

## Setup

I believe this is outlined in Gullibot - something like the first person declares who ordered Suggestron, the next declares where it's going, and the next declares what the problem it's been sent to assess and solve is, and the remaining players give sensible tips for how to proceed once powered on (such as mission tips - think "loading screen")

You might also have a round of character bios, or you can choose to skip your turn

So maybe you have, like, people at the table * 2 - (number of special opening steps)

## homage

this is kind of like the opeing to The Prisoner or Escape from New York, or all those movies that start with random information being retrieved (kind of like the opening mission log of Alien), or even the intro of Evangelion

maybe players are also allowed to inject "flavor/suggestion images", like, throw them into a pot, or remove them (or maybe just "move them down the field" if they want to signal it's getting played out), just at will, as a wordless contribution

you can also throw in cards to suggest people grab as their random-radio pull

## Turn structure

You can add observations to the table by acting in accordance with observations in front of other players - when you can cite a "rule" you've observed, they move to you as tokens (ie. cards turned sideways - or in a different pile, see below) that can be spent (put in the middle of the table, so any player may observe them)

You end your turn by having something come to Suggestron over its radio link, which (unless the DM / group consensus gives it a pass, ie. if the radio is being used to bring in new information that draws the curtain on a bit before going further) causes play to shift to the next player. Any "followed observations" that weren't used to cue further observations ~~are returned to the center of the table~~ can be used by the player to add a new observation later, or can be "stolen" by another player on their term in the interim.

## environment rules

In short: you have your "Observed", and your "Sensed" box, and they're like "Inbox" and "Outbox", or your "Hand" and "Plays" or what have you.

And the middle of the table is like Fluxx rules: they belong to the table.

Other players can treat either box as something they can pull into their Hand

## The Radio

information over the radio can come in lots of different ways (these are just narrative framings, they're no different mechanically):

- the result of a query
- "pushed firmware update packet"
- or as a mishandled interception of random data

This can be used to "upload firmware", like building the explanation that you use as justification for an action

you can introduce information that contradicts another player's info. when you do this, you return their card to the deck (with the understanding that it can't be "recalled" unless, like, it's someone telling him "no, fire absolutely is dangerous")

## An observation on how this refines a confusion of Gullibot

I think I originally thought there might need to be some kind of restriction to say that Gullibot takes an action, some resource that has to be spent?

But, like, no, you want people to be primed by Gullibot's actions - you want them "yes, and"-ing the shit out of it

The one-in-one-out rule ensures that people don't just go expanding the ruleset willy-nilly, and the addition of a "sensor" increases the opportunities to pick up unobserved knowledge.

If there end up being too many rules in front of players (ie. two players are swapping fifty details back and forth between all their terms), the ability to delete multiple rules with contradictory information allows for this scenario to be reined in (like "elves can not fix the reactor" removes all the rules about it being a good idea to pursue the elves' plan)

## One possible issue

I do kind of worry about "ground truths" getting overused as tokens....

Okay, you know what? Maybe you can't take from the center of the table. You can follow it for cues for your actions (and players can buzz you on failing to act in accordance with a principle), but the only way you can introduce new knowledge is by observing the rules introduced by other players

This is maybe what the idea of "give up your turn with the radio" comes in: you can use it to, without needing to make it diagetic, insert new information that contradicts a rule that's keeping you from doing a lot of stuff you want to do.

Also, to be clear, you're allowed to use your own idea if you stole it back from someone who took it but didn't use it

## on dialogue

(this is the part that's like My Daughter Queen of France)

dialogue is handled by players hopping in to voice whatever character is described in the scene.

players who are not playing a character can choose to add information based on dialogue the other players say... I'm honestly thinking "whenever they want," Whose Line style.

Going by the rule I laid down for Gullibot, though: you can only record a new fact from dialogue once you've finished writing the last thing you repeated

At the start of dialogue, every player gets a card. The player whose turn it is can only voice Suggestron

The player playing Suggestron can choose not to play in the scene, and just write observations about the world based on dialogue

## on characters

Do we maybe have characters be cards? I like that: they're dossiers in the middle of the table, which players can pick up to "play a character"

Maybe we need Suggestron to be the one who makes observations about characters, though. And maybe that's an alternative way to end a turn

Yeah, I think that's solid, this is the MDQOF angle to it: if the Playwright says it happened, it happend. Adding a fact about a character to their character sheet counts as a radio lookup, because Suggestron verifies this observation with the All-Knowing Computer

Anything else is just hearsay and lies, exaggerations...

If a character trait is becoming too burdensome, it can be removed from the character sheet with a "clarifying lookup"...

or maybe we let this be a thing that's subject to "new information", and you're not allowed to change character stuff?

You know what though, I'm thinking I'll just go ahead and have it so that observations about characters can come out by the same card rules as other observations. You can choose to have them by radio or not.

The one thing I'll say is that you can't call out observations when you are taking an active role that isn't the bot.

## character biographies

I think maybe we let these be like "micro-cards", and whoever's playing the character is allowed to insert or cross out (or re-insert) whatever lines they want (though, remember, that's being a dick)

in Hubs, this can be handled by a link to a dynamic web page showing the character sheet

Is there a way to set the thumbnail size/resolution through, like, viewport meta rules for Hubs/Reticulum or whatever?

each player should get their own "marker color" to distinguish their contributions. this can establish ownership/not-sharing-well-ship. Players should ask if it's okay if they take a character introduced by another player.

in Hubs, you can make players that aren't currently in the game a completely different color (like, dark ones vs. light ones)

## Extending the "anyone not playing a character can introduce new cards based on the dialogue at any time" idea

I like the idea that this "observation injection" should be allowed for any time in story description

Or, no, right, what you'd have these for is when you bank your observed rule card and don't use it to introduce a new

It's just that starting a new turn gives everybody a blank card.

And that's how "observing a rule" works: it goes from the player's Outbox to the middle, and the player who did the Observation gets a blank card.

Also, instead of taking a blank card, you can choose to reuse a card by restoring it from the Memory Heap of cards that are not currently in play (either discarded from this game, or left over from a previous one). You're free to insert whatever you want on your turn (so long as it's diagetic and you have a "blank card credit" for it, or the free radio transmission that can end your turn), but on others' turns you can only opt to insert rules based on observing what's happening in their scene.

Note that the diagetic thing cuing your contribution doesn't necessarily have to be a result of the action you took based on a rule to get that card.

## The Discard Pile

the "discard pile" is a pile of details that have been suggested as things to observe

## The idea

Suggestron takes every fact and suggestrion it observes and incorporates it into a philosophy of the world which it

These are stored in Suggestron like Video Game Advisor screencaps

https://deathgenerator.com/#win95 is a recommended one

https://deathgenerator.com/#wea is also funny

- Players can browse the deck of "cards we've used in the past and didn't feel like burning / retiring  by the end of it" at any time
  - See also the "mood board", which can also have things introduced to it during gameplay
  - This is also the "recycle bin / discard pile"

## Implementing this in Hubs

So, you'd have card images be generated like Foone's Death Generator (but in some store where they're uploaded and available)

and you could browse the "local deck", and also we accept Imgur

(the upload to the local Reticulum instance, I suppose?)

You could have the cards be stored in a Trello clone - one board for players' hands, another board for table piles (the "still on the table" and "deleted from the table", which can be archived at the end of each game to serve as the "asset bank")

You could even have a bot enforcing the rules - automatically flag/label cards as "Met Knowledge" (if a move is rejected, they mention why they rejected it as a comment on the card, like "did not tap a recondition first")

Maybe they're tapped by default, and it takes from the top or bottom (maybe based on how any kind of card that's auto-generated might go?), but you can also have

you can also use labels for suggestions like "Personal, plz no steal"

Do any of these clones allow better labels than single-color stripes? Like, can I have gingham labels? Can I have git-badge-style labels? (That'd be AMAZING for CCG simulation)

## went way off track here

Looking to model this Trello style, I started thinking, again, about [generalizing a view of dynamic templates](45wb7-wyq86-hk9rs-jccr8-9bbgr)

## Oh man, though, speaking of Hubs

You could make it so players *set their avatar to the character they're speaking as*

## Possible inspiration

The "need to match a rule you believe before you can learn a new thing" kind of resembles actual machine learning models, like [Advantage Actor](https://hackernoon.com/intuitive-rl-intro-to-advantage-actor-critic-a2c-4ff545978752)
