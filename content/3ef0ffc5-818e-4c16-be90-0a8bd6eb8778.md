# The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity

**Metaquiddity.** If you're getting tripped up on *trying to ascertain if you're getting tripped up on* whatever it is you're getting tripped up on, you're probably suffering from a problem of Metaquiddity. (I say "probably" due to the treacherous nature of the problem.)

That's just what I can say about it right now, that I've had these thoughts below on paper and out of my head for long enough that I could link to this page under an arbitrary symbol confidently enough that I wouldn't goof up about the name. It's taken a lot to find this space: to see what it was like trying to work *through* this, read my original notes below.

Careening like a tire on fire out from https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects/issues/14#issuecomment-359223134

This is one of the hardest traps my brain falls into, like the robots in Futurama (which inherited this gag from Star Trek) all being fundamentally susceptible to destruction when encountering paradoxes:

When I find myself considering *what it is that I'm considering*, and whether I'm considering that - and how to *convey* the consideration of trying to find the words to describe trying to find words to describe... (repeat ad infinitum)

This relates to the wat that the worst feeling is [forgetting what you were about to tell yourself not to forget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbIldQpFy4), or what you were trying to remember.

Hopefully I can now bail out to pointing to this file, and not get caught up in whether or not it *is* this file that I should be pointing to... (the more complicated that decision is, the more evidence that this is, in fact, the file to be pointing to)

The vertigo of staring into infinity is one thing, but the confusion of *struggling with the concept of struggling with concepts*, woven with the comprehension of the recursion, confusion, complexity, fractality, the general tesselation and [hyperoperation][] and scope-jumping of all the manners in which the question can be *rotated*, just compounds the loopiness *so much more*

[hyperoperation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation

related: the exasperation of knowing there's a whole noumenon, a whole school of concepts that I can't access, just because I can't recall or ascertain the correct terms to search for to find an adjacent article - this is a feeling I have with Alphabinary Encoding particularly, that someone out there *must* have had the idea before me, and written more about it than I have, but I can't find it because the vocabulary I'm using to describe it doesn't match the vocabulary *they* used to describe it, so we're two ships passing in the night in terms of Google search results

anyway, what's funny is that I've noticed the exit for this loop tends to look like carving a big hole in space called "OTHER SHIT" and putting everything in there, even if it's not the same, like, remote class of concept. It kind of ties into this whole thing that's been going on with how I'm reworking Appendices in the [Office of Barfspace Development][OBD] right now.
