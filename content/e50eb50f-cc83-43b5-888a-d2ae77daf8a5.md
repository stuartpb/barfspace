# The Shadow Curtain

This is meant to be the page tracking and alluding to repositories of content that is kept foreign to these notes.

## Brainstorming "quest"

Taken from the only Barfspace Quest that was moved to the Operations page and not later rearranged to be under [Operation Trapper Keeper](1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md):

- [ ] Set up a private bagtent tree for notes that should remain unpublished and private.
  - [ ] Figure out what'd be an appropriate way to distribute this.
    - [ ] Keep a master repository in an encrypted repo on a USB stick on your router-server?
      - [ ] Complete the "Flash Open-Source Router Firmware" quest (which I don't think I've written up yet) to unlock this path.
    - [ ] Keep it on your desktop, and just try to keep it booted into Linux forever?
      - [ ] Unlock the "Booting Stutendo Under Stushiba" tech to make this a more feasible idea.

## rehosted note from Loose Notes

blackbeard's treasure public/private/secret three-layer personal disclosure classification model?

heck even just describing what a Blackbeard's Treasure gambit is would be cool
