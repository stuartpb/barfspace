# Makin' Games

Here's a cavernous, echo-y place where projects can live:

## What is this I don't even

- [Plolitics Alpha](tkne8-6x20c-w9976-6zs57-nbvwj)

## Tabletop Games

- [Gullibot](dwet6-czjp9-pja2r-w4q6e-vge7m)
- [Pro Cons and Law Rats](r47hr-774db-c48gt-3etja-gqtr9)
- [Writing the Ship](98t75-s477r-8a9ht-2zw21-dm1rm)
- [Ultimate Secret Trump](qs0t6-t7cwz-msa7k-yvzev-ftjas)
- Any number of tabs from my old OneNote notebooks
- A general hub for Shuffled Cards (or maybe that's just what this page is)

## Game tech notes

here are some other pages collecting things around developing video games:

- [Game engine design notes](a6p7e-asarz-wyagd-gdchg-b2crj)

- [my PICO-8 notes hub](rbkxd-7sca3-4naj9-6jz5q-5mr87)
  - this has a game project link on it at time of writing
  - once it has a page for game ideas, it should link in here
