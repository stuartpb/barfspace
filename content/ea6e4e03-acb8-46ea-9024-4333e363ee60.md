# Understanding Lua

This is... well, read the Background section, I'll try to explain there.

This structure is mostly copied from GitHub, where this was published as a repo with most of the drafting being done in issues (before being migrated to notes.stuartpb.com and archived about a year later).

Before that, this was on Trello, and before that it was in my OneNote notebooks.
