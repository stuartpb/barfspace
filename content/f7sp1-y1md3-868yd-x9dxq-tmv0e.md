# Mechanical Computers

An adjunct to my page on [What is Computing?](mxy04-xhrty-wz8vn-996xd-9edr3) to iterate that computing is *abstract*

THis is a neat concept that touches a lot of

- The [Tinkertoy Tic-Tac-Toe Computer](chqcm-k42pr-e2abr-y0yqk-01fgh)
  - The [Tic Tac Tome](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18490871-tic-tac-tome)
- [Dr. Nim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg) uses logic-like "gates"
- [This world-record-setting domino computer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w), which also illustrates the concept of a maximum density

I also like Wireworld, which is an abstract "computer" you could chart out on paper, like a circuit diagram, but could also make with any other structure that can implement these logic rules, I don't know.
