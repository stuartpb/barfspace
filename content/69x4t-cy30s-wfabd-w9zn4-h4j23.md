# Answers for Unaccompanied Intake

TODO: go back and introduce the context for all the questions these were written in response to

---

Melatonin, occasionally Pycnogenol, cannabis, caffeine, protein powder, the occasional multivitamin

---

Okay, but what am I supposed to do if I'm *not*?

---

[REDACTED - do not fill this in until all text has been saved]

---

Hard cider, stout, maybe once a week. Or more, but in general, I don't think I've ever had enough not to know what I'm doing.

---

Postvaporized cannabis regularly and a coffee every morning.

---

Depends on your point of view. There was a stretch of my life where I lived recklessly (my "twenties", in decimal), and I have the scars to prove it (quite literally).

If I had not gotten the love I needed, at the times that I got it, I am certain beyond comfortable calculation that I would not be alive today (or, at least, not alive as I know it).

---

Both of my mother's sisters lived recklessly and died by their own hand. My father's side of the family are all wildly successful capitalists. Whether that makes my father's side of the family any less mentally ill rather depends on your definition.

---

I proposed to my wife (then girlfriend of six or seven years (or something like that)) on the dock of South Lake Union Tuesday (sic, and my apologies), December 25, 2018, with a Ring Pop (for which I do not apologize, and am in fact rather proud), and believe it or not, she said yes after all of this, and we got married on July 11, 2020 (or something like that - you'll have to understand, everything was pretty confusing back then).

We're still together, and we're very, very happy, and I pity the poor sucker who can't believe that's still true. (Especially if it ever isn't true, this'll probably still be true.)

---

I live in a big bed with my wife.

---

High school, some DigiPen (which is technically a "college", too), no degree whatsoever, School of Hard Knocks, I know how to Google things I understand and how to understand things I don't Google.

---

Professional Stuart P. Bentley impersonator (ages 0-Z)
Unprofessional Wiseass (ages 10 and up)
(note, all ages are Base 32 Crock, if you're doing it right)

---

All of the above (the "Human Condition"); euphoria (possibly gender as well); ESP (WIS+)

---

Technical uncertainty toward all of the above, on account of my not being a doctor

---

Well, everything you'd learn in therapy, obviously.

Discovering that the (source of the GUT Feeling) Great Unified Theory of Everything (source of the TOE FEELING) is an entropic equation I have known since the first time I was 10 (in Decimal, that time) known as the Law of Too Much Information, which is expressed O(f) = tmi, because of course it is, almost by definition. (I'm almost worried that Douglas Hofstadter had this idea first, and has just been waiting for some other poor sucker to come along and take credit.)

All kinds of new "jokes" fall out of this equation when you play with the factors, just for the purposes of comedy, such as The Law of Communication, which is O(fu) = tmiu, or the Law of Entropy You Just Don't Get, which is f = tmi. All of these are funny, which, by the rules of the Tautological Only Equation (O(f) = tmi), makes them very, very useful. Anybody who wants can continue with this infinitely. I cannot be any more specific than this within the spacetime allotted. (laughs)

---

To ensure that I'm not going insane (ie. losing my capacity for communication, both literally and non-literally). I believe everybody understands me perfectly, and I'm worried that makes me mad. I'm terrified at the prospect that, by having a sense of humor, they're just humoring me. (If somebody's paying cash, I worry about it less: I suppose I could also charge an audience, but to do it in front of an audience that's paying to laugh, I want an audience I'm paying to heckle me. And, to my comedy audience: If I'm not paying you to heckle me, don't be a chump - don't do it for free.)

My good friend Max sent me on this road long ago. The road was bumpy, but I'm here now, and that's what matters.
