# Bottled from Municipal Sources

One thing that's played a huge part in my open-source radicalization since high school was realizing that pretty much all commercial software innovation is like bottled water: it's, with few to no exceptions, mostly based on public innovations, shared by everybody and made possible by the most rational scientists and engineers, with maybe a few unhealthy additives, with a shiny label and price tag slapped on.

It's why Ajit Pai calling the Internet a "free market innovation" damn near gives me a fucking stroke.
