# barfspace meta collection

The following are a bunch of files reflecting on the arbitrary nature of barfspace, by their original name in the "docs" directory before I moved to this UUID-based content model:

- [The original README.md for barfspace][old-README.md], before I replaced it with the current one
- [being-messy.md][]
- [collaboration.md][]
- [emergent-behaviors.md][]
- [hemingway-style.md][]
- [history.md][]
- [shipping.md][]

## Also

Files dating back to the old tree that weren't in `docs/`:

- [the-thing-about-weird-twittering.md][] was previously just filed under "The Rest", and now it's propagating out to other indices
- [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity][metavertigo], about the terrifying cognitive loop of trying to get too meta

Future meta posts can go in a new list under this line
