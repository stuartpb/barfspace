# a little thing about hopepunk

There's this idea in my head that feels like it'd be better if it were let out.

it's like... it's a little bit "hopepunk", which is another thing I've been thinking about lately.

Arthur Chu had a thing lately about how non-descriptive "hopepunk" was as a label.

I've decided my definition: it's a genre where the protagonists are at a clear disadvantage to the opposing force, which threatens to end all existence, by every tangible measure. Not only are they outnumbered: they're also materially outpowered by every other metric. They don't have superpowers (or any kind of superior equipment), and they don't have any kind of secret that would bolster their confidence (like reinforcements being 24 hours away).

Elements of this are key to *any* good Hero's Journey (and, honestly, the fewer of these that you're discrepant from, the better), but it's the combination of *all* of them that makes a work Hopepunk, for me: the protagonists have *nothing but hope*, nothing but the recognition that they're the last line of defense before the end of the world keeping them going.

There's gotta be the distinct feeling that the heroes here might just well *lose*.
