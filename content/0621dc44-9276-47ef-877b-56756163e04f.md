# the history of barfspace

## what this page said when it lived in a tree

my original plan with this was to just have a workspace where I'd keep a bunch of files and never commit them to Git or push them to GitHub

I ended up adding the thing that autocommits and pushes because a) I actually do like version history, and b) I like having my content pushed to GitHub

what I had a problem with was trying to make things fit into neat commits. originally I was thinking "oh, sure, I could just do it like a work-in-progress branch", but that still had the problem where I'd put off making commits

and then I was like "what if I made it commit every time I save the buffer" but then it's like "okay, so now instead of being afraid to commit, I'm afraid of saving the buffer"

so now I've got this kind of hybrid setup where the text editor autosaves and then it only commits if I either hesitate or get really into something

which kind of makes sense

## more thoughts now

okay so this can be my most Eristic version of a history page, I'm just going to throw random confusion into all this to let it be a little weird jot space for any time I have a memory I can't cleanly fit into any of the other history stuff

but I've been thinking there needs to be a better history central node and I'm not sure there currently is one?

I should go check the [Visitor Center][]

[Visitor Center]: 434dd429-b16d-4924-996f-aaf2ebff29ef.md

hmm okay maybe there isn't one, weird. anyway yeah, I'm gonna see if I can't starrt weaving this page back into a cohesive "history of all my dang iterations of this notes project"

I guess I'll just go ahead and start dumping links to other clearly-of-historical-interest-or-otherwise-recollective pages here

- [the first README for barfspace][BSR1]
- [the last README for barfspace][OBR] (where I'll retry to summarize the Barfspace span of these notes' history more cleanly)
- [the stub for Musings][Musings]
