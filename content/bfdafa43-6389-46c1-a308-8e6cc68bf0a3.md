## Factbook thoughts

(this section has been shuffled around a few different pages - it's an idea for one possible application of BISNES/BIGDOG, you can pretty much ignore it)

Want to revive w5-graph as a bagtent just called "whoswho" that has even looser notoriety guidelines and is just in general way less strict about everything - the proposed structure of the YAML files is basically like that, but for lines with internal (and external) links instead of k:v pairs, and oh hey now we can have freeform metadata content that isn't directly link-based, and we don't break external references if something changes (and we don't have to do tricky fancy footwork to rewrite internal references worrying that we might break something if we don't update a name correctly)

yeah in hindsight this idea seems kind of stupid and pointless, BIGDOG is like the version of this that doesn't have the problem of "who is spending time to make this, and why does it help them"

like if anybody's going to make something like this it'd have to be in the style of a CIA Factbook and have the same operational structure. It's still creepy, but at least this way there's a clear target audience it was written for
