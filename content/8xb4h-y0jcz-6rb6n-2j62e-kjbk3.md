# Installing sturl from USB

As of September 2, 2020, Raspberry Pi 4Bs can boot from USB

I did some stuff listed in [this brief log](z5mqm-htecj-whbfj-wsa6w-sy8r1) on stuberry before giving up because this was dumb

got too bored trying to describe it: basically, even after I jumped through all the hoops to make the Pi able to boot from USB, the installed system still had a bunch of problems booting (I think it was a constant console spew of kernel problems)?
