# Introducing the context

In which I explain the world as it is, and how that's drawn

I sit in a chair in the middle of a void: this is the "Dashseat" I'm talking about. Sitting in the chair doesn't really correspond to any programming construct, it's just something I do. I suppose I could also be standing on some kind of platform, but even in illustrated form I'm lazy.

Values appear out of thin air, because of course they do. Don't beat yourself up over this, or you're going to start being unable to sleep at night trying to determine how a number is formed.

Operations are just actions I take: similar to how values just appear out of thin air, operations just sort of happen in closure between panels.

Immutability: everywhere a value is seen, it's the same value. (See [this page][issue3] for more thoughts on illustrating / explaining this concept.)
