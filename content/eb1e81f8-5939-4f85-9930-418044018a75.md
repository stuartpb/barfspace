# Barfspace Office of Construction Plans

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way.

This is for sussing out the structure of a plan itself. For following its implementation (so far as anything needs to be done point-by-point, instead of in one big commit), see [The Barfspace Arc in Quests][barc].

## Hey, you know what

Maybe all development plans should have their own pages? Like, that would make it a lot easier for things to just get abandoned per the natural organic nature of my notes' manic bagtent growth plan, instead of cluttering this page up so much.

Maybe I'll make that my next priority in the next big commit.

## The Great Merge and Rebrand

See [this page][great] for a plan to merge pretty much *all* the notes into barfspace, obliterating the boundaries of what was originally barfspace and what wasn't (because, in truth, it was *always* barfspace, all of it, all along).

This is more-or-less done, but I haven't really had the time to go back and check, so... yeah.

## Not technically a construction plan, but distinctly related

We need to get the damn tooling for auto-saving and auto-committing pages back up! I think this is listed somewhere in [Quests][], but, oh yeah, that reminds me:

### a thought on that added later

I really do need to get auto-committing back in place - I feel weird destroying things without it, when these things really should get destroyed.

Stuff like this next part, which is largely done:

## Reworking the Near End [Reworking Right Now / News / Quests / Projects]

My thoughts are that Quests (and its associated outbounds) will become the main driver for documenting what I'm up to, with [What's News][checkins] becoming more like "this is the mailing list / forum post that led to this change to the quest listing" (when it's not a Git commit or GitHub issue discussion or anything like that), and Right Now becoming like the Phoronix or LWN post about the latest updates / status.

In BTTF terms: "[This one][Quests] shows you where you're going, [this one][rn] shows you where you are, and [this one][checkins] shows you where you *were*."

There's more thoughts around that at the end of [this page][great] now

## Reworking the Far-Out End (Where the Sidewalk Ends)

Plans to rework The Rest, Appendices, and Loose Notes (and maybe more?)

The previous section is about redefining the *descriptive* stuff, this is about... the *intake*. I don't know how to describe the difference between these two plans, but it's there: they're not mutually exclusive, but they're not interlinked the way that the other is... augh. This is triggering [metaquiddity vertigo][].

I guess the idea is that here's what be best:

- A page for "this page would be in a category of its own, if we had more pages" stuff
  - Most of the things that can't be easily described in those terms should live over in the tumbly wing or around Musings
  - This would basically be what "The Rest" is right now
- Loose Notes, at the very end
  - maybe we'll just put our finger on the scale for that
  - or maybe we'll just suck it up and use random UUIDs like they're random and opaque like a gentleman
- A page for Appendices and Indices in General
  - The Rest being the catch-all Index and Loose Notes being a catch-all Appendix
  - I think the reason I didn't create a Loose Notes page initially is because I thought that's what [Cut Comments][] was going to be
- A page for general Categories / Mood Boards
  - This is an index at the top of the Indices? Or somewhere prominent, like maybe near the bottom, but not The Rest, because it's for indices that are fuzzier and more subject matter-y? whatever
- A Best Of page
  - the redevelopment plan for rehabilitating [this goofball][bofa]
- A "Tour" page to introduce and lead into the "Best Of"
  - That was what I started doing with [this][not-ln] before I got all mixed up
- This plans page

## Organizing and Expanding the Linkdump

I think the old Linkdump used to be an entire *notebook*, if not an entire tab... it was a big deal.

Right now, I think there's a single link in it? And it's a pretty one-off link, to be sure - but there are still useful ways to classify it (it's an *Internet Archive* link that I want to memorialize *in archived form*, for instance, that's at least worth a page. Could even cross-reference it with [unlinkable][], as a general "stashing shit as the Library of Alexandria burns down" repository). Anyway, I can still have a "crap, I don't know" runoff, but I think I could make up a *lot* of the content I've been wanting to stash, back through *Clipsnail*, in Linkdump form (I guess the original Linkdumps predate Clipsnail... wow, it feels so weird to be [so archaeological about my own past][xkcd 1360]).

anyway I think it can cover a lot of gaps that are currently being split between Chrome's very-much-dead Favorites browser and my Tabalanche history (the one it can supplant being, of course, my old Favorites).

Also, note on in case I do that whole flowchart for how I handle impulses: it might be worthwhile to write up how I've channeled my urge to share online content over the years
