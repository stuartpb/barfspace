# Making a new board in Lean Notes on Trello

First, I would copy the "! Template" board, which had three lists: Previous, Overture, and Read On. The "Previous" list was pre-populated with a card linking to the "! Overview (Start Here)" board, with five labels applied for it to stand out (green External Link, yellow Internal Link, red Instruction, purple Protip, and blue Education) - this was copied from the way Trello themselves did these kinds of board, at one point.

This was the checklist I had on a card on [the Introspection and Plans board](296d1028-3a37-407c-a28b-a36f197696d8.md) for steps I'd follow from there:

- Come up with name and Overture
- copy the Template board for one with the new name
- Create a card on the Overview, with label and URL
- Copy the Overview card to the previous and next boards' "Read on" and "Next" respectively
- [FIX] Check that the previous and next board's "Internal Link" label is named
  - This was because I was gradually fixing an issue in the original template
- Move the previous and next boards' top "Read on" and "Previous" cards to the new one's lists
