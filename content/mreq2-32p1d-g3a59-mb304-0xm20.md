## basic idea

individual storage containers go through the now-melted icecaps, oscillating between North and South based on which end of the planet has more sun exposure (as the vessels are solar-powered, due to ecofascist governments having monopolized carbon fuel for the mass transportation of troops and weapons)

people of Iceland have made it a point to capture individual shipments at a rate low enough that it's written off as an acceptable loss

## boneyard

"ulf of alask", after how Google Maps writes Gulf of Alaska
