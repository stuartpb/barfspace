My current thinking, which I'm putting in the draft, is that the first table would make more sense as *properties of a thing*. After that, we might try a sideways table like "Professors to Hometowns", or a ranked list - but property objects are a *very* common use of tables, and it'd make sense to start with that (especially since that's, like, how we're going to access every global library function).
