# My Life in Quests

This is a kind of legacy page, tracking the following pages, which all have their roots in a great giant page I made for Quests back in the early days of this repo (might have even been before Project Akira, I'd have to go back and check).

These days, I'm changing a lot of these pages into subject hubs that aren't quest-oriented.

For documentation of the old Quest content, see [the Quests Style Guide page](13ff3791-e256-443b-9b76-6ce1a594c7a8.md).

Note that I'm *really* moving toward just obsoleting this page and letting to-do lists emerge organically right now - I'm just straight-up deleting the pages that have been woven into the notes from here now, especially the stuff worked into the new Projects tree

## Pages that have been reworked

These pages have gravitated into more modern configurations:

- The three major branches from the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] were originally quests:
  - [Operations][BQO]
  - [Visions][BQV]
  - [Implementations][BQI]
- [Desktop Quests](445ae6d8-5796-43b7-8648-704c8ebb9e18.md)

[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md
[BQO]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[BQV]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md
[BQI]: 30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md

## Still kinda relevant maybe

- [Mindfulness Arc](2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md) oughta get worked into somewhere where I'll think about it

## Largely unvisited since Quests was made

These are unloved and, if you asked me what's in 'em, I probably couldn't tell you.

- [Network Neighborhood arc][NetN]
- [Unusual Studio arc][Unusual Studio Quests]

[NetN]: 8905d737-8f2a-4de7-a850-c1f2b04cd45e.md
[Unusual Studio Quests]: 21528cfb-1ac3-4428-86df-86bb77154a23.md

There's also a bigger-picture list of quests at [Quests: Angst Edition][angst-quests] that I only touch when I'm feeling existentially lost?
