So this is an old idea I had back in 2013 (judging by when the card was created on my Projects board - I'd likely had some variation of the idea before that).

The idea, as I originally thought of it, was to have a website with one giant "time stream of everything", and you could add events to it with any time and date and accompanying data.

(I used to have a lot of these kinds of ideas: "Let's make a site that contains a certain kind of data, then everybody who wants to make that kind of data will magically appear and start using it!")

Today... I don't know, maybe there's an adjunct dataset you could append to Wikidata?

The vision, I guess, was that, if you wanted to prove a point - like, for instance, the emergence of shadowy characters in the mold of Fortinbras, or one of those "lineage of Linux distros / whatever" charts - you'd be able to hop on Timetress, and all the points
