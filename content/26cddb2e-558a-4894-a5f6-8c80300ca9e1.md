# The Evolution of my "Help Wanted" approach

Continuing from the entry for help-wanted on [The June Judgment](b7b835c5-d843-4888-ae53-bd8aef36d5cd.md)

The "Help Wanted" repo was a neat idea, but... I don't really know how to work it today. If I come up with a suitable replacement that's more functional than just my Project List (like, maybe something that's holding cursors that've fallen out of Right Now), I can link it from whatever stub is linked on help-wanted-s tombstone.

Also, that tombstone should note that it's mostly redundant to Unusual Studio Projects now - the import page might as well also include a subnote for the 4 projects that aren't integrated into that tree.

## Revisiting in Reintegration

The [Hall of Champions](d02fb1fb-3fff-4ca0-a26c-bf82e6f20e46.md) has emerged to take the place of my old "Help Wanted" repo

## To remember

the Unusual Studio Projects list, and the idea of Unusual Studio in general, was another kind of re-take on this
