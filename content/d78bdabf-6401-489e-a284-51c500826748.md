# Frameworks and Scaffolds

These are for project ideas that are meant to be used as a base for bigger things, or something like that

see [Components, Features, and Parts](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md) for projects that, like these, can touch a lot of other projects, but fro mthe opposite direction

- [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) (the tools and spec that govern barfspace itself)
- [wayside](21af29aa-0dfe-4145-877f-7eb51e38f53e.md)
- [plushu](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md)
- [NilPass](7e171d29-590d-4636-9c2e-80cdaef10e92.md) (kind of, in that it blends "components" like Hashblot/splat)
- [printacle](d984a489-8c56-4665-a106-d6b4909319c8.md)

## sort of scaffolding-ish?

- [casettic](4abecfee-9100-45f3-9566-4d5234924dd2.md) lays out a storage model that could be used as a springboard for other stuff
