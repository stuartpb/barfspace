# Conflict is True

And, like, if we disagree, and you can tell that I know we disagree, and I'm happy about it, and you're happy about it, and then we both act in a way that suggests we believe the same thing, does it really matter who was "lying"? It's like paying attention to which way your ballot was flipped when you put it in the envelope. Caring about the words that were said is obsessive. And yet we're so compelled! This leads to a society that's inarguably out of order - disordered. What, am I trying to diagnose our entire social structure as encoding a form of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder? No, that would be ridiculous.
