# another simple markdown operation for linting

Title-ify URL: visits a URL and replaces it with an inline link with the target page's title

Could be suggested by a linter - you could even make it a suggestion that you have to either accept, or angle-bracket or string/code escape the URL.

Real useful for linkdumps

This is kind of in the same vein as "List Refactoring"

## Another use of this extension

This could maybe be applied for existing links? Like, this seems like it could be cool for filenames

Though, really, tooltips / other editor affordances would maybe be better for that
