# Problem Base

This is a page for aggregating various software issues I've found but not reported, and other things in my life that bother me (mostly in a desktop/mobile sense, but that scope might expand - we'll see how this continues).

As they say, necessity is the mother of invention: some of these might evolve into full-featured projects to fix the issues they identify. Others will probably just lead to a simple pull request.

Single-system issues (ie. "I broke X"), which tend to be more forensic in nature than inventive, will be found listed on pages for their corresponding [pet systems](1c1b77bb-9e37-4d0a-9dd2-5bafbeee15f5.md).

See also [Desktop Quests](445ae6d8-5796-43b7-8648-704c8ebb9e18.md) for general improvements

For broken physical objects, see [Junkyard Daydreams](33bcb20b-5d20-42e5-8eba-15541882e48a.md).

## Per-system problem indices

## General problems

- [Volume Level Normalization](05d4a116-d930-46cd-9aa3-36f83ce5ec95.md)
  - Solutions are currently based around Linux and mpv, but that scope could probably expand.
- [typing in the dark](e4656a48-10a4-43c4-af22-fa26aab0f7ba.md)
  - like, honestly, I guess it's just uncommon that I have a problem that doesn't immediately turn into a project, outside of system issues like these? but this page seems like it should be broader

## Linux problems

- [O Brother, Why Can't I Print From Thou?](02fa1f7d-e17f-4c4d-a43d-b89fa6a63efe.md)
- Chromium emoji issue
  - https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/overlays/chromiumos-overlay/+/refs/heads/master/media-libs/fontconfig/files/local.conf may give insights as to how to fix that

## Specific tickets
