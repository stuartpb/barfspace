# Adjunct religions/establishments to Bellarianism through history

(this started with me going off on a look on calendars so this also kind of covers that stuff for now)

## the Enlightenment

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_of_Humanity and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positivist_calendar are both Comte joints

## the Acid Age

- [the Hermetic Lunar Week](https://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/hlwc/hlwc.htm) - I love how there are enough psychedelic folks to cover the early alphabet in order
- RALPH Magazine
