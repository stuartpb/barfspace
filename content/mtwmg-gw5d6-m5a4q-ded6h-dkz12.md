# Helmbag Suite Ideas

This page gathers up ideas for suites of apps that would be installed and managed together.

## What is a "helmbag"?

A "Helmbag" is a repo of HelmRelease manifests for the FluxCD Helm Operator (as I'm planning to use for Stubernetes as of June 21).

It can be converted into a Chart if you want to version it (in which case it'd likely have its own Helmbag entry in some higher-level construct for local customizations)

In other words, it's like a larval Chart that's nothing but subcharts.
