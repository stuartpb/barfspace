Well, that's neat

## News covering / introducing Deno

## Ideas I've gotten after seeing Deno

note that these were both just vaguely remembering the concepts I'd seen, not actually reconciled with how Deno does it

- [a new approach to package management?](63v9w-akptj-ymass-h1qbs-259wx)
- [npm-style management for Deno-style includes](zw2t9-8b5qp-ca8bk-0gmg6-thfrn)

## WASM

It supports WASM, right? [yes](https://deno.land/std/manual.md#wasm-support)

What about WASI?

Isn't there another thing that was doing WASI? wasmtime / wasmer? Could these projects be altered to be compatible?

## native plugins

I can't quite tell how native packages are supposed to work? I guess https://deno.land/x/plugin_prepare/ is how? (found via https://deno.land/x/webview/plugin.ts)

looks like the API is [up in the air](https://deno.land/typedoc/index.html#openplugin)
