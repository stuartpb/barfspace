# Honeydew Browser

I haven't actually used Beaker Browser, but I'm thinking that the traditional browser model could maybe be rethought a little more for a federated ecosystem than just "Chrome with a few plugins bolted on"

Considering the manner of this abstraction, this might make sense as a layer of the [Windowsystem Metabrowser](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k). Like, maybe all transports are implemented as Deno scripts?
