# Artifact: original board description

This is where I'm rough-draft / brainstorming notes for glasstub.es.

Instruction: Actions to take (including links to other sites - the action is "go read this").

Protips: Points to consider.

Education: Knowledge to apply.

These don't *strictly* break down but a card should be mostly one of these.
