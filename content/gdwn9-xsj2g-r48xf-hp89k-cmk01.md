the TF2 halloween event ends tomorrow and I haven't even started. I used to love TF2, but something about it now just hurts to play. I feel like the whole random-play community has become so toxic that I just don't want to deal with that right now.

and yet, because it's a rapidly-approaching deadline, I can't look away, I can't focus on any of the things I should really be doing otherwise.

I think one of the things that's been causing me some gut-soreness is having this spool of PETG sitting out and trying to think of something else I'd like to print in PETG before I swap it out for something else... I'm also maybe kind of wary of printing this potentially-abrasive Conductive ABS on my nice Prusa nozzle, but, eh, whatever, it looks like there isn't a lot of conductive material in it, and I'm not planning to print that much with it. the first thing I want to print is actually a vacuum attachment system, so that static doesn't build up when I use my Shark to vacuum-seal some filament in zip bags
