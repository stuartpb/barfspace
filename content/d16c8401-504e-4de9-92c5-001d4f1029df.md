# Lifestyle Helmbags

This is for stuff that every person has

The line between this and [Professional Helmbags](ae0f6969-d62b-495f-bdd5-028b2205a255.md) is kind of blurry

- [Static-Site-Hosting Helmbag(s)](80cdaafa-9d29-41e0-9131-4346f36dc040.md)
- [Plain Old File-Friendliness Helm Bags](8aea78fe-9cbe-4284-a57f-ed3756f477ed.md)

## Home Automation

- Something for MQTT light control
- Assistant backend
  - agents (ie. smart mics) would run their own client images to do all the stuff like listening for wakewords and anything else that'd be feasible for onbard calculation on cheap hardware
  - like, is it possible to use the ADC on an ESP8266 to do wakeword recognition and waveform streaming?
    - do we still need a RPi for that? (would even the Zero be able to handle that?)
  - this'd work best on a machine with a TPU or GPU to do that kind of signal processing
- see notes on [smart plug stuff](92b3ba74-2df9-4879-9e9c-234421cece41.md)
