# Last Sunday September 2020 Cluster Teardown and Rebirth

Running `hostnamectl set-hostname $(sed 's/\..*//' /etc/hostname)` on all nodes - I mean, this is what they were already doing, I'm just making it consistent

Did [403 Network Setup for October](67349126-64cb-45d9-82c9-39e2c027a232.md) last night

Rolling out [The New systemd-resolved plan](0a31453b-10db-4867-b108-1cc794f479ff.md)

## teardown

running `kubeadm reset`

gotta remember to remove /var/lib/rook on ALL worker nodes, due to mon placement

running `rm -rf /var/lib/rook` on each worker node (not present on sturl)
