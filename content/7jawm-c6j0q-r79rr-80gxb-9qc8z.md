# Thoughts on the jurisdictional duties of the Beyonder Consulate

Old GitHub structure doesn't count, that's just an adjunct operation within the mainline historian duties (though that will probably be a focus of the how-i-roll Trapper Keeper work)

This will probably start a joint venture with History Force for documenting archaeology into older note structures like OneNote and Trello

The Beyonder Consulate always has a close relationship/rivalry with [Operation Trapper Keeper](3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca), which wants to integrate notes, and especially those in foreign historic predecessors: having the Beyonder Consulate do a thorough documentation job makes it easier to pass off to The [Notegraph Historium](rjnhy-tyar8-05aw9-svgbr-akn86) without having to go through [Archaeology Force](xance-6ev1z-rb8tq-dw3f5-caz42)
