# Emoji on Stushiba

I can't get Emoji to show up in Chrome in my Arch Linux installation, and I can't figure out why.

Ought to post a thread about this on the Arch Linux Forums to track the issue down.

Might also need to open an issue in the Chromium Bugtracker for it - I've been assuming it's an Arch issue, but it might be a problem with the Chrome render path (maybe even a driver issue). Anyway, the Arch people are better at identifying which upstream has problems than I am.

## Things to include when making the ALF post

Note that I have not only Noto Color, but all-repo-fonts installed.

Should include screenshots of https://getemoji.com/ to show how bad it is.
