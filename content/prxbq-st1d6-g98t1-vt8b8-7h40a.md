# IP (Pi) KVM notes

For [recovering wpi-amethyst](hmth7-ryhd2-cs8t4-gad87-ae3gf) and general [Out-of-band management](9h7fa-r6jgd-m58zj-s5rap-xv4mk)

- https://mtlynch.io/key-mime-pi/
  - links to [this plain old thing](https://smile.amazon.com/AEMYO-Extender-V3-0-Ethernet-Supports/dp/B01LGUT9HW/) for HDMI forwarding, ie. for Pi-as-USB-keyboard only
- appears to have developed this out to [a fully-featured solution](https://tinypilotkvm.com/products)
  - but charging $300 for the whole thing put together
  - $170 for a "hobbyist kit"
  - $70 for just the license
    - not sure what that's about since [it's already open-source](https://github.com/mtlynch/tinypilot)
- [this thing on Amazon][D2CIM-DVUSB-HDMI] looks like it has all the right parts, but the interface looks like it requires some kind of major-league KVM thing to deal with

[D2CIM-DVUSB-HDMI]: https://smile.amazon.com/Raritan-Dominion-Computer-Interface-Module/dp/B008EEHRCS/ref=pd_sbs_14?pd_rd_w=eJTNs&pf_rd_p=3ec6a47e-bf65-49f8-80f7-0d7c7c7ce2ca&pf_rd_r=WPXEER155P7RRZKS8REN&pd_rd_r=ae5ceaf4-9136-4e46-b363-75680a148329&pd_rd_wg=QGAUa&pd_rd_i=B008EEHRCS&psc=1

So anyway TinyPilot is undoubtedly the way to go here
