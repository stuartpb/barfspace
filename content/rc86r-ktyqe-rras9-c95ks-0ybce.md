# shenzhen i/o emoji keyboard spec idea

a toy version where we'd represent these quirks in a symbolic 999-codepoint character space

maybe we say the spec is powering a raw character-insertion lookup table behind the scenes

or maybe we actually use byte sequences for the emoji?

the latter seems kind of out-of-character for the breezy style of the game's usual simplification/level of abstraction

simple output to light when any key is lit? nah, we'll say the UX issue with not generating characters initially is solved by each key having its own light tied to the switch.
