# Petlogs: the fleeting lives of mutable systems

This is a page for the general trees of "machine I do projects on that I want to document every change I make and headache I fix".

## See Also

The [Problem Base](t1zk1-jqgcq-wq9ag-dgkdj-p64y5) page collects some of the standing issues that span these systems

The [Desktop Quests](8hded-p2qjr-yq8cj-3g9j7-bq7gr) page collects some more cross-cutting-concern-type plans

There should maybe be another page tracking prototypes (and, like, Quadration work?), so, like, my NeckFX setup is linked there

## some old bullshit

See the [About Petlogs](yspay-9rvj8-wd8kw-ebf5q-x2qg7) page for some background and philosophy behind these pages (some of which is out of date, as it refers to the directory structure that originally spawned the layout of these pages).

For more on how these logs are going to be restructured amd integrated going forwward, see [Camp Papalima](9xr5p-sec7k-w6a4n-nebsb-qfmmp).
