oh sweet I just realized the search keys are (of course) rebadged Windows keys, so tapping them pops to Expose (or whatever GNOME calls it), exactly as you'd expect it would

`sudo pacman -S inkscape` (which brings with it `ttf-dejavu`, among other things), because I have an idea I want to sketch

removed the useless "Software" store app that just comes up empty from favorites - if I can figure out a way to make it in any way useful on Arch (like, I don't know, for browsing flatpak apps?) I might add it back (though I highly doubt it)

## GNOME Tweaks

Made middle-click on the titlebar (in the "Windows" properties) set to Lower
