# Operation Trapper Keeper

This is now the main note under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] for the continuing work of integrating outside content that began with [Project Akira][]. It's kind of a cursor for where a bunch of legacy work is at: a base camp to address newer developments in while trying to disassemble incomplete thoughts from a different time into pieces of a newer world, for structures from before the notes started coming in.

[Project Akira]: vbfwb-sefpv-wx8hg-5wts5-s3zmc
[DoB]: xcf83-y2s77-w59jc-21g12-032mn

I guess this could also be thought of as a sort of Ellis Island, a receiving port for outside content, since so much of it pertains to integrating material from my pre-merger writings.

For more information on things I'm struggling with in these notes, check the [News][] (though notes-news hasn't been authored so much lately as of early-June 2019, with more attention haivng been given to projects that are described here writing their plans in the spots where they're gonna be implemented - possibly a side-effect of this Department's infrastructure having developed out a bit, with abstract zones popping up like Camp Papalima and How-i-roll's Tomb to work like meta pages that can shift in focus between different "teams").

## Current sprint

The [June Judgment](pyw3b-her8e-48awm-xxhbq-kdngd) is coalescing to consider a definitive plan for integrating my remaining lingering repos.

[this older page](r4wza-p72m8-cd92h-7106m-j3210) should be reintegrated into that and deleted

## Continuing operations

A History Force, developing a more robust archaeological infrastructure, inspired by a reread of the notes on Project Akira, has been moved to [how-i-roll's Tomb][])

[how-i-roll's Tomb]: qfntb-snnda-gx9ah-w284r-hwz8j

History Force will continue to review non-historical comments on [the standing Project Akira page](vbfwb-sefpv-wx8hg-5wts5-s3zmc), and work with the standing contingent of Opkeepers to integrate cut content that's still relevant into locations elsewhere in the Tree (maybe commissioning new branches under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] to address unresolved points), and summarize / artifact the content that has a place in understanding the history there (remembering that non-summary versions of stuff that wasn't clear can be read through history, if there's "forensic" need to review exact wording).

[DoB]: xcf83-y2s77-w59jc-21g12-032mn

The continuing integration of petlogs is tracked at the outpost at [Camp Papalima](9xr5p-sec7k-w6a4n-nebsb-qfmmp).

## Other remaining integrative work

Migrated from [the page that now lists divisions](mfrzq-ch8r8-wj9a3-bdbdx-ffkc4):

- [lingering tasks from after Project Akira](34c9a-rd78c-999hb-33k0b-y168h)
  - [the planfile postmortem](ydct3-s9y9z-8g8qr-rd0rt-wezm4) still needs to be integrated better (TO DO: Work with History Force)
  - See the "detritus" below for what should become a dedicated Planfile Archaeological Expedition note
    - moving to [planfile historic expedition](na999-h6tqn-gra5p-tvqtv-26vwe) under the [Archaeology Force](xance-6ev1z-rb8tq-dw3f5-caz42)
    - next to [The Right Now Outpost](vqf81-6650g-8ka3r-k582q-b2vnh)
