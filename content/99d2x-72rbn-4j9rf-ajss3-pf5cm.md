# Bulletin on the Problematic Content in This Tree

After looking at the thing [the tweet this page was created in response to](https://twitter.com/FanSince09/status/1087451258137399296) was in response to, I decided that it was meant to be a little more tongue in cheek than delivered, and it just felt like a two-levels-of-irony-removed exercise in salvaging sincerity the absolute wrong way.

And that's something I'm going to need to reckon with. (In hindsight, this is the due date I put on that, or at least the week of it.)

I ended 2018 on a kind of shit impulse that colored my 2019. I felt like I was the only one batting from the heart, and I'd, you know, Rick and Morty some shit. Be goofy and then hit people with deep Bojack-Horseman pathos they weren't expecting.

I guess... I'm thinking about this thing JP Brammer wrote recently, "Reflections from the 'This!' Factory", and how our current media landscape is borne out of wanting to feel lke our main problem is that we're keeping things silent, which, if we're being honest, we're not.

There's a whole path to go down there and I think that article really puts me in the right headspace for it, but I think I need to focus on a particular piece of it for a moment: feeling like everyone sees me as a hollow shell devoid of genuine feelings for anyone else.

## differences going forward

Now, there is a [Shadow Curtain](wm7ba-3ycgc-wn8h2-pjnsv-xny45) where I can work out stuff, but a big part of these notes is that I don't want to be too afraid of exploring my feelings on something to let that stop me from documenting it fully.

## what do do with what's here

I've been thinking about purging it from the Git history with a rebase - I never told myself I'd commit to a pure write-only history - but, honestly...

the cuts would be too painful to amputate. Holes in my thoughts. Gaps in my brain matter. Lacunae that the world wasn't built with.

Here, I'm burying it one level even further down:

> ## The First Act of Bell
>
> The first act of Bell is Stuart P. Bentley's comedy show [The Unconvincing Truth][], which is currently in a pre-Discordian state of chaos, where I was in a very... non-peaceful place.
>
> Having finally found Eris, I'm able to kind of chill out on some of this shit I wrote there, so... yeah, like, that act is going to get some work done soon.

> [The Unconvincing Truth]: 710sk-j03n1-wh9hy-7a048-zwy4p

As Pope, I'm okay Da-Vinci-Coding this out of the Notegraph entirely. (Im fact, I honestly think Stuart's name shouldn't appear in the Book at all.)
