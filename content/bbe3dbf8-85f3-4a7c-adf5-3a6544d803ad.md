# Proquint Naming Thing

Okay, so, you'd have a language where everything is consonant-vowel pairs, like Japanese

and there'd be 16 consonants, and they'd be written in some form that corresponds to a square of 4 bits, in order

and a similar deal with the vowels, each's character corresponds to the "bits" of the vowel somehow

so like the "B" sound would be represented by an "O" (a round stroke through, all 4 bits are 0), and Z is "X" (a solid slash through all, all 4 bits are 1)

the "sides" would be represented as a "half x", ie. a rotating V (with the "strokes" going through the bits) - after typing the diagram below, I'm thinking they're maybe "double-stroked"

the "diagonals" are slashes

the ones with three ones would be rotating Ls? hmm, that would conflict with the Vs, and break the "parts of an X" metaphor

I guess "diagonal T" makes as much sense as anything (I mean, after typing the diagrams below, I guess it's a "Y")

the single-bits would be rotating Qs (the "tail" going where the one goes)

OK, so here's what I was describing above:

```
 B     D     F     G     H     J     K     L
/ \   X \   / \   \     / X   \ /     /   \ /
\ /   \ /   X /   /     \ /         /     /
/ \   \           \       /   \ /     /   \ /
\ X     \   / \   / \     \     \   / \   / \
 M     N     P     R     S     T     V     Z
```

This is meant to be an elision of a strict "gate" representation:

```
 B     D     F     G     H     J     K     L
/ \   \ \   / \   \ \   / /   \ /   / /   \ /
\ /   \ /   / /   / /   \ /   \ /   / /   / /

/ \   \ \   / \   \ \   / /   \ /   / /   \ /
\ \   \ \   / \   / \   \ \   \ \   / \   / \
 M     N     P     R     S     T     V     Z
```

what I described as "Q" would probably be drawn as a "C-", on reflection, like the power icon.

and then you'd probably have something like this to mark vowels:

```
A  I  O  U
   |     |
-
      |  |
```

## naming

everybody has a four-consonant-and-vowel-pair-syllable first and last name

so kids would be born with a random seed coming from... maybe you flip a coin for the first 24 hours of their life, and that's their first name.

I was thinking last name would be assembled from the parents, with first and second coming from the first syllables of the first and last names of the parent giving birth (determined by some kind of social proximity in cases of surrogacy), and the third and fourth coming from the same from the other parent.

The core idea is that names would be genetic like this. The both-parents-contribute-equally-to-the-name thing is fixed, but maybe different castes/regions follow different rules that reflect cultural attitudes (like using the first and third syllable of last names, or a different syllable from each name for each parent) - charting out the different implications of different systems is p interesting to consider imo

anyway, you'd also have a two-word middle name, where each word goes consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel-consonant, that the kid picks for themselves in a coming-of-age ceremony. until that time, kids don't have middle names: if there's some kind of tried-as-an-adult scenario that calls for it, they're named as "babab-babab", meaning 0x00000000 (also, "babab" means "baby")

and so that's generally how things work: people are addressed by their first name as a random identifier, but in social settings, are more generally called by their "handle"

example: Mozaroni Zokap-pudij Dadonotu

names are expected to never change - to change any part of one's name is to become a completely different person in the eyes of the law

names are often presented like this:

```
MOZA ZOKAP DADO
RONI PUDIJ NOTU
```
