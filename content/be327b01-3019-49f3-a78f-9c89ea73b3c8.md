# 3D printable TOY guns

  - I was thinking of this cool toy gun I had the other day
    - It had slide-moving action, would make the "ch-chk" if you moved it manually, and had a little "bottom slide" button you could hit for a "reload" sound
    - Been thinking it'd be cool to remake that
      - Also, what if it had, like, a better speaker, and a strobe light
        - And, like, a camera? Some way to tell where it was aimed
          - Laser beam?
- [another one like that](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4202903)
  - this one comes with a disassembly tool built in
  - appears to be NERF-dart compatible?
  - has slides for accessories
