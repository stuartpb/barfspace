https://codeberg.org/hjacobs/kube-ops-view

from the dev who (later?) made kube-web-view

- pros:
  - nice little task-manager-esque visualization
  - has Helm chart
- indifferent remarks:
  - codeberg? okay? I guess?
- cons:
  - not really a dashboard (no editing)
  - a face only a hacker could love
