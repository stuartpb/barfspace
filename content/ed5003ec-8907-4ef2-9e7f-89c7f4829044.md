# how the fuck do I FPGA anything

This is mostly for advanced Quadration at some hypothetical point in the future.

I know I've got a whole smattering of links to tutorials and cheaper FPGA chips probably Tabalanched away somewhere, I should pull from those at some point

These [Agilex][] chips sound pretty smart, is there a way to get in on a cheap dev kit for that?
