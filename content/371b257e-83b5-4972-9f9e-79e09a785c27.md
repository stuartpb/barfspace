# The Neighborhood

This will be the central nexus in the Neural Network Neighborhood of my notes for the concept of "The Neighborhood", by this name, which crosses a *broad* strata of endeavor.

Basically all of this has some internal connection in my mind to the life's work of Fred Rogers.

- praisefiles et al and The Clusterhood (not gonna link these right now so as not to create Cursed Markdown before the bagtent rigger is manifested)
- It Takes a Neighborhood
- Mister Rogers, the biopic
