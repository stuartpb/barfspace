# Changing a Tired Mind

You can't really attack anyone's beliefs head-on. The only way you can get someone to come around to your point of view is to pick at the edges: find the parts of their worldview that they're legitimately frustrated at

It's like... you need to find the people who deal with cognitive dissonance by expressing genuine frustration, not by becoming obstinate and defensive. and it genuinely feels like that's a personality thing, to me? but aybe it's not

I think it was [this tweet from Omar Rizwan](https://twitter.com/rsnous/status/1105952263565074432) that got me thinking about this - you're not really in a frame of mind to understand something until you're inclined to agree with it

or, as Upton Sinclair put it: "It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends upon his not understanding it!"
