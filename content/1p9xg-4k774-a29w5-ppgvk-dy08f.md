# Quadration

this is my note hub for Quadration, right now it's only linked in a couple places and only has a few to-do lists but that can get better over time

- [Timeframe Expiring Ticket Ideas](zf1ep-tqfqg-0ea1z-8ycfh-ttnm8)

## The First Timetrain

- [ ] Get the C quadrator up and running on Abe.
- [?] Measure Abe's quadration rate.

## The Case for Abe

- [ ] Build an OpenSCAD encosure for Abe.
  - [ ] Build a base.
    - [ ] Make the pegs more forgiving so the motherboard doesn't keep snapping them off.
    - Also, remember to print at 100% infill.
  - [ ] Build a front.
  - [ ] Build a back.
  - [ ] Build half of the top.
  - [ ] Build the other half of the top.
