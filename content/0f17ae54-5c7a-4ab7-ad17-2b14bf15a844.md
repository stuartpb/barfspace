# Quests as an Unusual Studio construct

I had the thought that "TODO" lists like those that originated under Quests would make sense as a way to structure Unusual Studio.

- [ ] Spend more time with this Quests structure before making further plans to integrate it into Unusual Studio.
- [ ] Maybe it would make sense to sort these "Quests" under both Arcs and Projects?
  - [ ] Allow users to vote / pay in at any level, and funds will be divided up beneath that somehow (evenly?)
  - [ ] The infrastructure to associate Projects to Quests is already in place (the "TODO" link points to a document giving a project's quests, in one form or another)
- [ ] Not all quests should be Unusual Studio Quests. How would it make sense to draw that line?
- [ ] Find a way to associate odd jobs into Unusual Studio, if not by using Quests.
  - [ ] Quests also work pretty well as Agendas, just saying...
