# All the Old Stubernetes Iterations

- [Studtop Mark I](9af1ee19-ac0a-46e1-8a9c-d6815a455f4f.md)
  - first single-node attempt
  - k3os, installed directly to a Chromebook's 16GB onboard storage
  - Longhorn attempted for use as attached storage
  - Fell apart due to running out of image space, naturally (regardless of Longhorn support)
  - Had an abortive attempt to reinstall to a 64GB USB stick that was called "Studtop Mk II" for a bit
    - as I would come to realize, this USB stick is far too slow for OS operation
- [Initial post-k3os plan](7de423da-53fb-499d-bd6c-59fb5d004163.md)
  - see also [Rebuilding Plans](9e684107-b6e6-4ef5-9541-41db74ccf19c.md)
  - when I first had the idea to [flash the installation media to onboard storage](97191518-e7e9-4a55-9962-69b7b6399f5b.md)
    - though this iteration was intended to be multiple-install-media-oriented
  - this is where I settled on Kubic-on-bare-metal
  - covers some of the other ideas that were considered
    - like a hypervisor using images from attached storage
- [Abortive Kubic Install to PNY Elite-X](3e9a1fd5-79c0-45ee-bf29-bffb9ed6a004.md)
  - I believe it's around here that I realized a MicroSD card would be cheap and fast enough
- [First Earnest Kubic Runthrough](55aeedd3-c454-4e9f-bd5c-09c654d62965.md)
  - this is what most "Studtop Mark II" references would be describing
    - it ends up being rebuilt and redesigned quickly enough that that label, itself, starts to blur
    - by the time the plan settles on a system design that wouldn't fail in setup, the name "studtop" was no longer part of it
      - this machine would go on to be renamed "stumethyst" in [the initial Kluster iteration](ef51a70c-487f-4706-8061-93156dc8415f.md)

    - [Trying to get OpenEBS Working](4d85dd50-a1f9-414b-bbfb-fdc9605e888d.md)
      - this is where everything comes to a screeching halt (the cluster got Cronenberged)
- The legacy of trying to bring it back:
  - [a walkthrough trying to retrace my steps](58ebafed-21df-46da-9c7a-ff91f51f06f8.md) (2020-06-17)
    - After looking at this, I realize it would be a lot easier to just recreate the chart installations as local documents
      - Like, why run Kubernetes if you're just gonna do all this stuff like the system can't be revived
    - aborted in favor of Helm-based preconfiguration
