# Infrastructure Project Ideas

These are ideas for services that would help facilitate other projects

- [All my Kubernetes Projects](950653f7-1ddf-4a58-a8bd-e3d2df544bb4.md)
- [A local-Let's-Encrypt-certificate-provisioning service](af61f26f-4813-4473-9550-cc038de75965.md)
- [Project Parking](839f43ab-9033-4bd7-a0a6-291d26415d34.md)
  - [DNS-centric design, ie Parked Project (Redux)](416491ee-4b52-4887-96f0-465f361a36ea.md)
- itself.co
- [Quadration](0d93d812-6739-4142-9e16-d686e6df00ef.md)
- [Accouch](1ae14fdb-5356-456a-a12f-89513f3a50ef.md)
- [Ops in a Box](035d1e22-7dca-4901-aa4a-1624e7a6a15c.md)
  - [kateskit](ebf47d2a-8719-4d66-80cd-dbbabaf98165.md)
    - [hardware model](5a99132c-ca94-4337-a969-d813309e4820.md)
      - [Router stuff](b602f316-66be-4411-a630-3ea6200abd15.md)
    - [App suites](a6b94843-8569-4a45-a25d-ae69a2d9fc22.md)
  - [The Clusterhood](9664b592-59ed-4ac5-bf15-9b67f67af111.md)
    - a higher-level "infrastructural" project
    - it'd provide a solid development base to build out this other infrastructure
      - (ie. each of these could be incubated within the Clusterhood)
- [MailShadows](8771b79e-068a-4e42-adc0-12ec61aecb77.md)
- [revokum](302bcc06-d1c2-4d95-83bc-b0dac2a949f2.md)

## Other adjacent kind of project theme indices

The [top-level project idea list](8509d6ba-3cdd-418a-82ea-94cc044b6aef.md) has a lot of other kinds of projects that could be seen as "infrastructure" that aren't the kind of infrastructure I'm talking about here, such as:

- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](d78bdabf-6401-489e-a284-51c500826748.md)
- [Infrastructural Data Institutions](fa8952af-648f-4d3d-a1a7-39b052123911.md)
- [Components, Features, and Parts](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md)
- [Community Wishlist](cbf8b20c-fd72-4c42-a543-952e046c893b.md)
  - all of these infrastructure ideas can be thought of as needing standing "communities" to maintain them
- [Method Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md)

## honorable mention

- [plushu](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md) would probably be useful for all of the above
- Rogueport was an extension to add hackable APIs to sites that didn't expose them, that's gotta be a class of infrastructure-like endeavor
- [carrier-pigeon-based networking](58594c81-a69d-4c63-a7b2-9f528172713a.md) could theoretically be used as infrastructure at scale
- [the glass tubes iteration of what became Lean Notes](0350c64c-4975-42fc-91ca-92007cd9bcaa.md) was meant to be like an "Infrastructure-in-a-box Starter Service"
- [windows registry prompted thoughts](36b96f1d-7022-4613-abb1-14af8ba5c25a.md)
