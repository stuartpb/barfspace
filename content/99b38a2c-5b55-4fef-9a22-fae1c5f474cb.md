# Cleaning Up a Horrible Mesh

I just went through an agonizing evening trying to get my [Infinity Gauntlet][] workable.

[Infinity Gauntlet]: 1647ef1d-19ba-4367-96cf-ef5bfc3a857b.md

What I ended up doing was taking the model, rocking back and forth between a couple of filters until the whole thing was forced manifold, and then doing a simplification (which just cleaned up the model's reckless points into a nice, normal shape that could be interacted with better in OpenSCAD).

I still had to run it through Blender's 3D PRinting Workbench or whatever the addon is called to put the finishing touch on it, though. (Note: I really ought to figure out Blender.)

Making the note here that the bit in OpenSCAD about manifold issues, the link to Wikibooks, should be revised for the latest version of MeshLab
