One of the biggest contributors to depression for me, and a big motivator for the priorities of the properties outlined in [SACRED][], is when something I own and depend on begins exhibiting defective behavior, and there's nothing I can do to fix or work around it, because the processes contributing to the defect are too opaque to understand.

This problem of opaque and irreperable defectiveness isn't unique to me, and I'm pretty sure the depression isn't, either. One of the gross things about capitalism is how the people who contribute to this opaque culture generally resolve the problem: by using their garish means to simply purchase a wholesale replacement (a purchase out-of-reach for the lower classes, who are expected to make do, through a building tsunami of [Vimes' boots][] that compounds upon itself).
