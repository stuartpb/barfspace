# On strings in Understanding Lua

Note from OneNote:

> - Strings: big solid cards with the contents of the string on them
>   - Cards have a [===[ pattern on the top and ]===] pattern on the bottom

I no longer believe this is the best representation of strings (it was echoed in Trello as "Strings are cards with the string written on them"): the one described in the current draft, where strings are strands of tape, is better.

*EDITORS NOTE 2019-06-08: What draft? There's no mention of strings in the draft I'm looking at. I'll go back and see if there's a C9 workspace with uncommitted content...*
