# Infinitely-Recursive Metaquiddity

Careening like a tire on fire out from https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects/issues/14#issuecomment-359223134

This is one of the hardest traps my brain falls into, like the robots in Futurama (which inherited this gag from Star Trek) all being fundamentally susceptible to destruction when encountering paradoxes:

When I find myself considering *what it is that I'm considering*, and whether I'm considering that - and how to *convey* the consideration of trying to find the words to describe trying to find words to describe... (repeat ad infinitum)

This relates to the thing I mentioned a while ago somewhere around here that the worst feeling is [forgetting what you were about to tell yourself not to forget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbIldQpFy4)

Hopefully I can now bail out to pointing to this file, and not get caught up in whether or not it *is* this file that I should be pointing to... (the more complicated that decision is, the more evidence that this is, in fact, the file to be pointing to)
