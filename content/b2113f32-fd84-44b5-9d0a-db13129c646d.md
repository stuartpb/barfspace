# Lever "More Info" listing for Glowforge

Looking at your listings on https://glowforge.com/jobs/full-stack-software-engineer and https://glowforge.com/jobs/front-end-engineer, I believe I would be an excellent fit for this position (it seems like they're kind of two listings for the same role, emphasizing different things).

I have a deep proficiency in HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, as well as experience desigining for the "*ilities" on the back end (testability, maintainability, extensibility, scalability, and "security-ility", as the full-stack listing put it). The front-end listing describes wanting candidates with SVG, Canvas, or WebGL experience: I have all three (having written SVG and Canvas code directly, and WebGL through three.js).

On the backend, I've had experience with Ruby, Python, and Node.js (mostly Node), as well as hardware challenges involving drivers, motion controller algorithms, and low-level code (having written software for the Pebble watch, ESP8266, and OctoPrint on a Raspberry Pi Zero W).

The listing asked for a few samples of my work - I have *many* things listed in various states of completion at https://unusual.studio/projects/, but for showcasing my SVG / Canvas experience, I'd link to a couple rough pages:

- http://stuartpb.github.io/mindsightapps.com/logo-color.html, a page I made to decide on the color scheme for a client's logo
- https://stuartpb.github.io/chachacat/demo.html, a proof-of-concept demonstration page for a module determining the "size" of an image with transparency based on the convex hull of its opaque pixels
