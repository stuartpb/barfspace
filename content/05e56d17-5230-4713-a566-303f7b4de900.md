# JS Timeline Libraries

This is primarily looking for a component that'd be suitable for [an animation / video editor](d20cd126-4a50-41b1-87bd-f6e533304058.md) and things like that

It also applies for "timelines" like TimeTress wanted to have?

That "timetress" idea can totally be done via Eleventy and Bagtent, imo (or, like, Bagtent and a custom renderer) - bottom line is you can do it in Bagtent with metadata blocks for the time bits

## cheating via listicles

- https://bashooka.com/coding/javascript-timeline-libraries/

## top options?

- [timelines in vis.js](https://visjs.org/)
  - also maybe a D3 alternative engine?

## not relevant here

- [Knight Labs' Timeline.js](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) [(3)](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/TimelineJS3) is for making timelines from Google Sheets.
- [Timesheet.js](http://sbstjn.github.io/timesheet.js/) - only makes static HTML timelines, so not useful here
- ProPublica's [TimelineSetter](http://propublica.github.io/timeline-setter/) is so static it's *Ruby-based*
- [SIMILE's Timeline widget](http://propublica.github.io/timeline-setter/)

## historical curiosities and other stuff

- [Timeglider](https://timeglider.com/about), a project with a jQuery library that got acquired by a modern timeline maker SaaS product called Preceden
- Another [jQuery timeline plugin](https://github.com/ilkeryilmaz/timelinejs)
- [timeknots](https://github.com/alangrafu/timeknots) for D3
- [chronoline.js](http://stoicloofah.github.io/chronoline.js/) - depends on Raphael and jQuery, only makes these little dot things
