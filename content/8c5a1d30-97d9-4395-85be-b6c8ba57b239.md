# barfspace meta collection

If you're looking for an idea of what Barfspace "is", you should probably take a look at the [Visitor's Center][visit].

[Visit]: 434dd429-b16d-4924-996f-aaf2ebff29ef.md

The following are a bunch of files reflecting on the arbitrary nature of barfspace, by their original name in the "docs" directory before I moved to this UUID-based content model:

- [The original README.md for barfspace][old-README.md], before I replaced it with the current one
- [being-messy.md][]
- [collaboration.md][]
- [emergent-behaviors.md][]
- [hemingway-style.md][]
- [history.md][]
- [shipping.md][]

## Also

A couple files dating back to the old tree that weren't in `docs/`:

- [the-thing-about-weird-twittering.md][] was previously just filed under "The Rest", and now it's propagating out to other indices
- [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity][metavertigo], about the terrifying cognitive loop of trying to get too meta

Then the tree was dissolved, and I started the **[How I'm Writing with bagtent][HIWWB]** page to hold some of my initial thoughts on this, but I got distracted and *forgot* about that page's vital importance, so I'm really only catching up on some of those thoughts now.

[HIWWB]: 13ceb37e-99d5-417b-be3c-ec7e1bc537ac.md

Anyway, I survived that, and I've added a couple more meta pages in the interim:

- [Circa-December-2018 dumping space for thoughts on the name "barfspace" for the seed incarnation of this project][name explainer]
- [Twitter DM about this repo to Gravis][cera]

So, here's a page that kind of alludes to some of the most critical history to understanding this repo (which has variously consisted of documents in lots of different places in the past, barfspace being one of the bigger ones):

[The old Musings page][Musings], since the actual Musings index was folded back into [meditations][].

That page talks about about how the disparity between https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations and https://ide.c9.io/stuartpb/meditations led to the creation of https://ide.c9.io/stuartpb/barfspace, which eventually evolved into these notes.

I really do need to get around to sitting down and writing a proper oral history of all this at some point. (Maybe I need to collect this over in that "history.md" file? Maybe I oughta grep content/ to see if I've already got a History page, or run bagtent-top-links?)

## Not on barfspace but crucial to understanding the idea

- [Eventualism][] and really pretty much everything about how a site like Wikipedia functions (hint: the secret ingredient is anarchy)
