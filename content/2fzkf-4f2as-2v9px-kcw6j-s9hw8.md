# The Style of Quests

This is a semi-historical document, since I haven't really written "quests" the way I did in the original sprint. History Force might end up linking to this for the oral history around this.

Referring to Stuart P. Bentley (mostly) in the second person, as one would expect from a quest tracker (as opposed to much of the rest of the writing around here, which refers to Stuart P. Bentley in the first person, singular or plural).

I've grouped them into categories like "Arcs" and loose quest categories: I think that kind of matches how they look in my head right now. I'm thinking specifically of how Crashlands did quests - everything you see here is something you're currently able to pursue, and what comes next can be a surprise once you have it.

"Plans" that aren't broken down into constituent paths that are mostly-non-blocked (ie. conjectural plans) are distinguished by a `[?]`, indicating that they're expected to be added once the previous objective{is,s are} completed.

There's some relationship to obtainables to be had in the branch/leaf nodes, but I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps there's something philosophical to be gleaned about what is phrased in terms of obtainables and what is not.
