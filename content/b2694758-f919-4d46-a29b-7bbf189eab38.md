# 3D Printing stuff

## Stuff I've printed and am using

- [The Turbine grinder][] and the funnel and funnel-packer from [gruppler's Pax 2 Tools][] (all they need is a place to put the lid and they'd be perfect)
- [Black Ram Hand Mark VII][] (I've got some ideas about how I'd like to improve this mechanically)

## Project Araminta

[Project Araminta][] is coming along: I've got a working stamp prototype fully fabricated and tested.

From here, the refinements would be around tooling - possibly some sort of frame to align the stamp precisely (maybe involving guides and knobs).

ughhhh son of a bitch I'm an idiot https://tubmanstamp.com/ - the sources were up at https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2537926 like two weeks before I started. Oh well... at least my version has a lot more SCAD composability - and I can gauge my version of the stamp against the original now. (And incorporate it as an option

## Ideas

See [Things I Would Like to Print in Various Kinds of Filament][filawish] for what is mostly ideas for stuff I'd like to print, either with no project attached or something
I could link to in one line.
