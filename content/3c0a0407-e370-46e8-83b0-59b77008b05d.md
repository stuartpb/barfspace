since I'm getting weird visual glitches in the GNOME shell and Bluetooth is having problems and stuff I'm going to try rebooting

## GNOME

I'm imaging a disk, and that's taking up lots of buffer, which, like the default cache color, is way too bright in the System Monitor plugin, so I set it to 50% alpha - only to find that its brighter shade combined to pretty much *cancel out*, and make buffer look more or less indistinguishable from program.

rather than bump the alpha down again, I decided to just set all the colors to `#00B35B`, and I'm pretty much appy with this.

## Fonts

Doing `pakku -Syu ttf-google-fonts-git league-fonts all-repository-fonts`, which did the `pacman -Syu`, and then I remembered that I don't want to upgrade all my non-repository packages (I want to figure out why they were installed and remove 'em), so I went back and reran that as `pakku -S ttf-google-fonts-git league-fonts all-repository-fonts google-chrome signal`

`ttf-chunk` was out of date, so I learned how to edit the PKGBUILD enough to set the new sha256sums and flag the package out of date

had a problem installing ttf-google-fonts-git fixed with the solution from Meltea's comment on 2018-08-26 12:46

removed the Adobe Source fonts to not conflict with the ones provided by this package

## Inkscape

Preferences > Behavior > Scrolling > Mouse wheel zooms by default

## GIMP and Printing

`sudo pacman -Syu gimp`

This ran into an issue with initcpio (probably one of the upgraded packages), and I wanted some printing support and saw `gutenprint` as an optional dependency, so I then ran `sudo pacman -Syu gutenprint`

still didn't see the initcpio run so I did `sudo pacman -Syu linux` to force it

### Running my label printer

`pakku brother-ql700` to get the drivers from AUR

`sudo systemctl enable --now org.cups.cupsd.service`

Went into the GNOME Printer settings and tried to add the printer and kept getting "Failed to add printer" failures

## Hex editing

I did `pacman -S ghex bless`, forgetting that `bless` would curse my system with `mono`. Ah well. It's like chicken pox: you get it once, then you've gotten it over with.

Wow, that's a LOT of certificates it's adding to my trust store, ok
