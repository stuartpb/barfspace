# On Sherlock Holmes, Loving America, and not judging football by a crappy Super Bowl

Man, I love America.

That feels *really* weird to say. Not just because of the last two weeks, but due to *all* the stains America's got when you look at it, both today and going back hundreds of years. Police brutality. Slavery. Gerrymandering. Women not being allowed to vote. Everything below "Career" on the Wikipedia page for Martin Shkreli. The genocide of the Native American people. The multitude of dysfunctions in our modern culture that are basically just centuries-old echoes of *institutions formed to normalize slavery*.

I mean, not to harp on that one, but if we're gonna run with the stain analogy, "slavery" is the stain on the fabric of America that's so big you can't even tell what the fabric originally *looked* like, there's so much stain, and so many of the *other* stains look so much like *that* stain, and we *keep spilling* the components of that stain onto the fabric afresh, which only draws attention to the way that we're *still not trying* to wash that stain *out* (though we've certainly gotten better at *pretending the stain isn't there*).

But, like, the *story* of America, the idealized one they tell you in grade school and Disney World, the one that only focuses on the way that a bunch of civic-minded citizens spoke truth to power, thought strongly about how to structure a government by *themselves* that would let them trust *each other* without letting any one person or niche have too much say, and then, against all odds, they *pull it off*?

*That*, I love. It's a great story! It's *timeless*! Those qualities, those notes *just by themselves*, in a way that could be overlayed again onto *any group of people* at *any time and place in the world*? It's *inspirational*, it's *aspirational* - going back to the stain metaphor, it's the high notes like *that* that make up "the fabric".

Like, imagine we could do it *again*, and this time we *have* women, we *have* people of color, we *have* intersections of these and dozens more representatives of marginalized voices. If we did that? *It'd still be America*, the way shows like Sherlock and Elementary are still Sherlock Holmes, because the follow the *fundamental character traits* of the original. (Even if they changed the name and the job, it'd still be Sherlock Holmes, like if instead of "Detective Homes" he was "Doctor House" or something, but was still a dispassionate cavalier with a drug problem and a knowledge of role-profiling shibboleths.)

And, like, the thing is, you can *have* multiple Sherlocks, and one can have come *first*, but there's still a consistent thread of "what Sherlock Holmes is" and it features things that only got established as fundamental reinforcements to that core *after the fact*.

The thing is, a country like America doesn't really *get* multiple tries where we can do it again, this time with the big unfortunate parts left out and some invigorating things woven in. Since we can only do that over time, we've really only got the one America, instead of several different incarnations. (We can try to rewrite history with stategic abridgements like Hamilton, but the reality underlying it all doesn't get a remake.)

Anyway, this is turning into a blog post, and I don't like these big arcing article things in this repo. I started writing this after the Super Bowl, but I've still yet to commit it, because it's an unfinished thought, and really, I have no idea which direction to go in with the threads that are dangling here. There was that whole thing I was going to seize on, about how Super Bowl LI was such a disheartening example of what a football game could be (well, disheartening when you consider the greater context of how the Patriots weren't an underdog in any sense going in et al), and weaving in the notion of the "bad guys" in that narrative being a team called "The Patriots" with this thing about American iconography I touched on above (And how it's inessential to the core of what I actually *love* about America), and putting the proper brackets around that statement, but yeah, that's all veering *so* out of scope for this repo. It's for putting *small notions* that can stand alone, not for being a messy bitch with streams-of-consciousness.

Honestly, maybe I should have a repo like that, but, really, I don't feel like this'd make sense as a repo. (Cue Ron Howard at the end of Arrested Development Season 3 voice) [Maybe a chat-based publication platform with tags.](https://github.com/dingroll)
