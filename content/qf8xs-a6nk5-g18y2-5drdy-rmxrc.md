# Infrastructure Project Ideas

These are ideas for services that would help facilitate other projects

- [All my Kubernetes Projects](jm357-xrxvy-mrahf-f3tbf-n8jwm)
  - [Ops in a Box](0dehw-8kxsa-81amj-gp4kk-td8cw)
    - [kateskit](xft7t-am737-c681k-evqax-fk0b5)
      - [hardware model](bach6-b6ajg-tqajt-er2cr-9wj00)
        - [Router stuff](pr1f6-5k6qs-0hacc-1ymrg-0nf8n)
      - [App suites](mtwmg-gw5d6-m5a4q-ded6h-dkz12)
    - [The Clusterhood](jsjbb-4jsxp-r5by5-cvczv-7nw8h)
      - a higher-level "infrastructural" project
      - it'd provide a solid development base to build out this other infrastructure
        - (ie. each of these could be incubated within the Clusterhood)
- [A local-Let's-Encrypt-certificate-provisioning service](nxgz4-vt82d-4k9am-6c0e6-yepc5)
- [address.exposed, but make it Shared](herds-tvdzm-w7a1w-1nswj-9x51w)
- [Project Parking](gefm7-awg6f-0qa19-h93mk-42q9m)
  - [DNS-centric design, ie Parked Project (Redux)](85j93-vjbaa-479dw-26bwv-1mdra)
- itself.co
- [Quadration](1p9xg-4k774-a29w5-ppgvk-dy08f)
- [Accouch](3bgmz-ptkas-baa2b-w9a4z-kmm7f)
- [MailShadows](gxrvf-7g6hb-m2avg-0jxhg-txjwq)
- [revokum](60nwr-1phrb-dn87f-5gvb1-ajjgj)

## Other adjacent kind of project theme indices

The [top-level project idea list](gm4xd-ehwvm-ca85t-mmsg2-4ptqf) has a lot of other kinds of projects that could be seen as "infrastructure" that aren't the kind of infrastructure I'm talking about here, such as:

- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](ty5xn-fv406-4ya51-2hrm0-84st8)
- [Infrastructural Data Institutions](za4n5-bv4hz-8xa39-ssp19-14e8h)
- [Components, Features, and Parts](sgm3d-n5d7z-ra8jx-4r3y6-cd6rp)
- [Community Wishlist](sfwb4-37xeb-42aag-wn5r2-6s2av)
  - all of these infrastructure ideas can be thought of as needing standing "communities" to maintain them
- [Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma)

## honorable mention

- [plushu](237wy-vyzdz-w39y5-va8ej-3r5g6) would probably be useful for all of the above
- Rogueport was an extension to add hackable APIs to sites that didn't expose them, that's gotta be a class of infrastructure-like endeavor
- [carrier-pigeon-based networking](b1cms-0d6kq-43afc-mzaa0-q4wat) could theoretically be used as infrastructure at scale
- [the glass tubes iteration of what became Lean Notes](0d8cc-k29em-qw93j-mj01y-dkf5a) was meant to be like an "Infrastructure-in-a-box Starter Service"
- [windows registry prompted thoughts](6twpy-7bg49-hkaqc-8mny5-tbgmt)
