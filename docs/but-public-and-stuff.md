two comments before I burn this file down:

> i love the idea of a blog where all the posts are just not even finished or in any kind of order and constantly changing, like even live-updating

this is the kickoff of the thread that eventually completed with the creation of https://github.com/stuartpb/stuartpb.plan

> aside: this is why I FUCKING HATE when people think Git is a synchronization tool and not a VCS, it's like, they've never recognized the power of context that historical metadata gives you, they're blind to the larger narratives that inform DOING SMART FUCKING WORK

moving this rant to https://github.com/stuartpb/github-mistakes/issues/13 and gonna spawn a new file here to really go off about something I've kind of touched on there
