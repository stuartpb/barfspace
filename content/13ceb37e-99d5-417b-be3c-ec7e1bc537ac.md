# How This Note Structure Helps Me Write

This page is meant to be a remake of [this old essay][how-i-roll writing.md] that described how I used to "write" by creating repositories that I could push incomplete thoughts to (and maybe a bit of a postmortem on how that never actually worked, in practice).

[how-i-roll writing.md]: 8801d68b-a815-4c92-b9af-503aa47b1848.md

This page focuses on how I *transcribe ideas*, like, in the sense of ephemeral concepts and essay material. There's also rumination to be had around [writing about work I'm currently doing][how I to do], which is kind of a different set of thoughts (but trying to convey the difference gives me [metavertigo][]?)

[how I to do]: f359a1e5-3e4f-4d30-8be3-0d0635c77ea4.md

See also the [general tooling and structure notes for bagtent itself](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md)

just had the thought that these tab names not having any display for what the contents are is confusing, and something I'd want to be able to solve with some kind of plugin for titles in [wayside][] - did I already write something about "something that can get titles from a programmable source" somewhere, this idea feels familiar - was I maybe thinking about default commit messages, maybe an extension to git-slum (and/or autocommit) to make it (them) more bagtent-friendly? TODO look at issues when it isn't 1 AM and my head doesn't hurt

also, I need to split that bagtent notes page into a few files - one thing should be separating "plans" from, well, this: actually, what am I saying, I should just make this subsidiary to that, since it's really not worth distinguishing "how I am concretely structuring my own bagtent flowchart" and "thoughts I've had around the bagtent tools"

okay I just went and added a link over there

so I'm not liking how this isn't getting auto-committed right now, and that's really because I need to write the bagtent-sprout script so I never put the repo in an "invalid" state by way of committing too early

Okay, I forgot about this page for a while, that was probably a mistake, but oh hey, cest la barfspace

anyway, the thought I wanted to jot down real quick here is that barfspace is like, essentially it's like almost modeled as a neural network, with the way that cells create connections arbitrarily and sometimes structurally but those structures are organic, subject to change, damage, mutation - but the content remains.

in other words, and I think I've said this a few times somewhere else around here before, but barfspace is **the first writing structure I've created that feels like an accurate reflection of my brain**

## The "I'll just put this here" effect

It's easy for me to lose a train of thought, so one of the cool things about barfspace is I can just put as many links to that train of thought around as possible, and then I can pick that train of thought up again if I re-encounter the link.

This happens especially often around stuff where "revisiting" the page will take more work than just trying to remake the page from memory, and it'd be easier to, like, remake it, and then cherry-pick what ideas from the "old" version can be "ported"

This is kind of how I intend to use the [Right Now][] page going forward, per [how I am currently trying to sort my shit out][GYST]
