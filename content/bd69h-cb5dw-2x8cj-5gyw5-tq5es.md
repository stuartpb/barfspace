# You Know What I Would Buy?

This is a quick appendix for project ideas I've had a want for, but not enough that I'd be particularly interested in pursuing it myself right now.

"You Know What I Would Buy" is meant to be metaphorical, I most likely wouldn't pay money for any of these things. But, like, a Twitter account described here, I'd follow it

- A really simple / easy-to-set-up daemon that mirrors every repostory on my account, and every organization I'm a member of, on GitHub, to a local machine, for backups, or really just some way to get up-to-the-most-recent-commit backups from GitHub
- A Twitter account that aggregates deep cuts from people who are actually working in industries that mainstream media is reporting wildly inaccurately about, like [this Tweet][1] about nuclear war, or anything Alan Yates says about VR
- a Twitter bot/account called "mistwanslate" that posts those ridiculous Bing translations Twitter suggests for posts that are in English
