# Wayside

https://unusual.studio/projects/#bdca5753-ed0c-453b-9c21-699e8c45d0e8

## the pitch

This was originally going to be my idea to "resurrect Cloud9" by completely remaking it from scratch, emphasizing the things I would do differently.

However, now that Cloud9 is ending, I'm discovering other projects with better momentum behind them that are tackling the bulk of that work, and I'm realizing that I'd really rather just have a better *hypervisor*

## model concepts

- workspace
- layout
- view (workview?)
- tree (worktree?)
- driver
- derivation
- connection
- instance

A driver represents a codebase that connects Wayside to

Maybe Drivers should just be called Ways. Or rather, the "driver" is just the technical term for the implementation of a Way

an Instance is a configuration of a Way

so you can have multiple Instances of the same project using the same Way

multiple Ways can be connecting to the same endpoint, but that's such a complex and fuzzy concept that, in the dashboard, they're treated the same as they would be if they were two completely different machines

## more

see the [old notes][], written with a different conceptualization of what level wayside would operate at, but largely contiguous with the new concept (the main difference is in believing that I'd have more control over the frontend design)
