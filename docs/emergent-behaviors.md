# Emergent Behaviors in the barfspace repo

This file is where I'm gonna describe some, like, impulses that have emerged since I started exploring this paradigm (beyond the stuff covered in [history.md](history.md)).

## Tombstone commits

so one thing that's kind of emerged as a thing I do in this paradigm with the git history and everything is taking a file that was really messy, figuring out what I was really trying to get at, then editing the file so it's just that, then, after the commit with that comment is pushed, deleting the file, so that last iteration is its "tombstone"

this is the kind of thing I'd kind of do in commit messages, but, like, I usually don't commit files so messy that I only have little kernels of workable content in them? so it only really becomes a thing in this repo

## Project files

I'm writing descriptions for some of my old ideas in this repo right now: donw the line, I'll probably come up with a better place to put them, but right now, this is the easiest place for me to write them.

## Vulgarity

From "The Zit", to "Snot Humility", to "Dickward Delegation", there's a sort of theme of liberating crassness flowing out from the top-level "barfspace" name.
