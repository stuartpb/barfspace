# The Current Report of Broken Notes

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the current nexus for my base of operations under the [Department of Development][DoD]. Update your bookmarks.

2019-05-07: Making a note here that I should revisit the Project Akira Great Notes Consolidation page to reflect on its thoughts as they pertain to how the issues I was writing about then have evolved and are evolving.

a couple days later: ALSO, [petlogs should get merged into these notes][petloggins]

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]

[deprechaun]: 2e874825-eb8d-4b42-9c31-dfcf4f30a799.md

I want to explain that Google Keep is a huge supplement to this repo, somewhere. I think there's a note about me needing to explain my note-taking process somewhere around here - I'll probably work on that, at some point.

TODO: Move all these "I want to X" notes here to the [Barfspace Operations][] Arc, which is, like... what this page (or its ancestors) functionally acted as during the bumpiest parts of the migration/merge into a unified repository. Anything on this page that's still relevant will get packed up and moved to there at some point, and then this'll just become a historical landmark as "The Triage Site", or as an ongoing note to store my angst and confusion as I try to reflect a omplex process across several notes that isn't true.

So yeah, there's a plan going forward for this page: "Known Issues". I kind of like that, actually. Be a little band-aid. I know that's why I felt I could make news updates on here: it felt like the context to understand why what I was talking about didn't seem to mesh with what the notes were saying was here.
