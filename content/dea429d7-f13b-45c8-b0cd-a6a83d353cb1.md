# A Bach-style rag

```
The point in the song   after                      one beat
Is half where you're at after                      two beats
Is half where you're at after                      one second
Is half where you're at after                      two seconds
Is half where you're at after                     four seconds
Is half where you're at after                    eight seconds
Is half where you're at after                  sixteen seconds
Is half where you're at after       thirty         two seconds
Is half where you're at after     a minute        four seconds
Is half where you're at after   two minutes      eight seconds
Is half where you're at after  four minutes    sixteen seconds
Is half where you're at after eight minutes thirty two seconds
and then it's seventeen minutes and I guess the pattern kind of honestly falls apart
