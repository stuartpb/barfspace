# Trello History of Lean Notes, Part III: Something to Do With It

I've added the dates the cards were created here.

## Journal 11: Naming for Founder Institute (2014-01-30)

I got sidetracked again before I could really implement my plans for glasstub.es, but I'm coming back to it for this week's subject in Founder Institute, Naming and Branding.

Also helpful: I have Trello Gold now for referring my FI colleagues.

On naming and branding, we've really come to something I want to talk about, so I've made a board for Naming and Domains, that will be followed by Brand and Design. Following from the idea of linearity going out the window, these will be linked *within* Getting Something Started. (Or not: I'm kind of carving GSS up so the new sections are based on content that is now pushed to one end, like I did before.)

Along the way (as I add new backgrounds from GIS results), I'm working on some of the re-layout stuff, including a complete overhaul of the completely-nuts Overview (making it into lists of "sections" or "parts" or "books" instead of a list for each board wtf)

Once I did the third section of Table A in the overview, I realized it was pretty shrimpy, so I added cards (not yet boards) for each of the cards I'd put in "Prospective Sections". I went on to make these boards instead of sleeping.

I reused the leftover lists for making the books / parts, and used some of the leftover cards for heading each part / section.

## Journal 12: Meta-meta (2014-01-31)

I split up the Meta board into 4 boards for the different types of content that were cluttering up the main Meta board:

- These History lists
- Sites that were / were not like glasstub.es
- What glasstub.es is supposed to be (style essays)
- What glasstub.es is becoming (instrospection and plans)

I then prefixed their names with tildes so they'd sort to the bottom, similarly to how Overview starts with a "!"

I finally got an idea for what glasstub.es can look like as a finished product after Trello. Unsurprisingly, it resembles the Trello layout a hell of a lot.

## Journal 13: Post-Feedback Session (2014-02-20)

I opened glasstub.es back up for a feedback session with Fog Creek this morning, and I've gotten back into thinking about what I'm writing.

I realized I'd totally boned the Computers and Phones section, which now had no room for what I'd intended to put in it (a description of the things that are and are not immutable in general with computers). Consequentially, I moved the content that was in the section into a new "Acquiring Hardware" section, and started blocking out the things I wanted to talk about in Computers and Phones. Now that Computers and Phones is back on-message, Enter the Web should fork some of its parts over (like the high-level description of languages, and character encodings, and probably Markdown).

The bits on the web languages themselves can stay in ETW (Computers and Phones can focus on "server-side" stuff that's currently not well covered by Writing App Servers).

I need to start moving the tag lines from the Overview to Overture lists

I really should have called Acquiring Hardware "Hardware and How to Get It".

Oh! I forgot about the purple-yellow pattern from Getting Something Started, I should look into doing more of that. (I've just been writing a bunch in the Yellow areas

## Journal 14: Into Hutpass (2014-02-24)

Started adding accounting to Hutpass, realized this is a topic that should be handled in Money and Money Handling, and is actually a more concise word than "money handling". Ran through a rename using a search for cards containing "money handling".

I originally didn't go with "accounting" because I wasn't writing on accounting and *was* writing a lot about services like Stripe. However, with a focus on the actual accounting, that Stripe stuff can go into the Monetizing column.

I've also started adding a bit on Search, because I was looking into setting up search for my own email. As I started doing a little research via Google and found that I was seeing articles from like early 2012 at the latest, I realized, in terms of relevance, "oh yeah, everyone just uses Google like I'm doing now", so I pivoted "Integrating Search" into "Being Searchable" since that's the gist of it.

## Journal 15: After Founder Institute (2014-04-09)

I'm closing / leaving / moving the boards I made for FI (as relevant). I'm taking the Tools board I made for FI and moving it into glasstub.es (as "Tools Index"): most of the relevant tools for glasstub.es are already mentioned, and I'm going to work on integrating / mentioning the ones that aren't.

The irrelevant tools (that are only relevant to the kind of crap FI has us do) I'm considering turning into a card like "glasstub.es for get-rich-quick MBA types" that lists the tools for doing crap like surveys and having other people make your site (things everybody other than glasstub.es talks about, that glasstub.es ignores because they're just expensive ways to get mediocre failing crap).

Since I have a thing for mentioning Handbrake, I figure I should include a board on what to do with big, fat CDN media files like videos and photos.

## Journal 16: "Plan G" and "Zero to Software" (2014-10-13)

Hutpass is planning on pivoting to some of the stuff in here.

I'm adding a few things around the idea of using something that *isn't* a server to prototype your site, expanding past just Human Components (now Manual Components).

I was talking to [Decalogist] and I mentioned how a dating site like GatherWing thrives on providing a few elements of its design to influence behavior rather than imposing rules, and I hit on the head why rules make things suck, so I figured I would start making a board for Community Behavior (now Community Cultivation), like a lot of the stuff I used to jot down in OneNote. (I should probably re-install OneNote.)

I also start realizing this doesn't cover any of how to try something without writing any code, so I figured I'll make a board on that. Brainstorming for something to concisely say "prototyping without code", I came up with "Zero to Software", which a Google search would indicate has not been coined yet. So I'm thinking that might be a tagline for glasstub.es, or the title of a presentation / book: I'm looking at getting the domain now.

Anyway, since that's an insanely powerful and awesome name, I'm going to keep that in my pocket for now, although I will continue with the board.
