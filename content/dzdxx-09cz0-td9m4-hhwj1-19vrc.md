# A Better Backing Store

One thing I've been thinking is that Git isn't the most appropriate structure for these notes: it's not *bad*, but there are probably better-scalable solutions to this, especially when

## A thought

I'm thinking now that I'd only really go for this if I start having real issues with Git. While it's admittedly a clunky fit for my notes

## specifically IPFS-focused thoughts

- [ ] Is there a Neocities-like app for pushing content straight to the cloud?
- [ ] This would make sense as a service for Clusterhood users. Progress on the Clusterhood arc to lay groundwork for a production implementation of this idea.
- [ ] Would there be a more sensible way to structure Barfspace for IPFS? Like maybe instead of UUIDs under content it's just a bunch of IPNS names?
  - [ ] Does IPNS scale like that? (Quest-meta-question: is it cool to just list questions as checkboxes? I feel like an answer needs more than a "check", but I guess that's the job of adding further list items that aren't checks?)
    - On that meta-question, I think peppering in non-quest-items as list items was supposed to be an integral part of how quest progression was supposed to be denoted, at one late-in-bed furious-braincrevice-digging thing or otherwise buried thought process that I'm starting to recover, how list items can be used to give periodic updates on progress
- Your questions on this arc are going to be kind of dumb until you've Learned More.
  - [x] Get back into the swing of collecting Lean-Notes-styled notes for my understanding of a technology, procedure, etc.
    - There's a page for this now. You should insert a link for it.
  - [ ] Integrate some of that stuff into the Lean Notes tree in appropriate places. (ED: this branch is veering into Operations-quest territory)
