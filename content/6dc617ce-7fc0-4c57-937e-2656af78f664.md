# NeckFX (tentative title)

A project using [ESP8266 chips](be8ef21f-ea6e-4f96-8b87-9a54694fb29f.md) to light a strip of WS2812s as a necklace.

## Wiring thoughts

The ground could be handled with a pin that is crimped to a wire crimped to a socket (with the power-in cable, which is crimped to the socket for the buck converter) for battery-power-in - crimped in with the wire to the three-pin plug to the strip.

The power is crimped from the buck converter to the wire plug as well.

The three power-side plugs on the ESP are tied together (ie. soldered) as a line, as are the outside ground-side plugs (remember, the ground crimp uses the double-wire into the buck converter for its outbound connection). The data pin from the ESP, however, *is* crimped, to the data line of the LED plug.

The battery chambers will be connected to each other by a ring or whatever, but they'll also be riding the cables from the
