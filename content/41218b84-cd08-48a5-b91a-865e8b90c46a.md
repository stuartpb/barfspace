## IPFS

I installed IPFS to see about experimenting with it as a replacement for sites like Thingiverse, Soundcloud, stuff like that. Also have some ideas around putting a name layer around IPNS and Tor addresses

## Rust

Went ahead and installed `rustup` so I could build Xi, so, hey, might go and try learning Rust. Might do that as part of my general looking-into of WebAssembly.
