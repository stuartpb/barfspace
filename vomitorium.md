vomitorium means exit, it doesn't have anything to do with ralphing ya dingus

but yeah, this is totally a space for binge-writing

okay so when I originally started putting this together I had this thought like "lol I'm going to go on these meta tirades every five minutes with everything I write in this way, might as well not do anything to separate them out", but, like... it actually ended up making me not *want* to write anything in this that *wasn't* meta, so, actually, I *am* going to make a subdirectory for all the meta stuff

let me try this change I just made to the autocommit script first

Man, the timer is longer than I thought it was

fun fact, after I committed the timeout script here I literally had to squash out 120 intermediate commits that had been made

okay I reset the timer because the way Cloud9 autosaves, it waits until you've stopped typing to save, and that means, if I typed continuously for five seconds, the "changes are still happening" test would think "oh, there are no new changes, I should commit now"

This can still be a problem if I go a full ten seconds without a break when typing, but I think that's kind of rare, and in that case I kind of do want it to commit and push the changes since the last pause in typing anyway, so...

anyway stopping here to do that move I was talking about doing earlier
