# Data Smuggler's Cove

## Theses

- [Setting the World on Promethean Fire](content/97e9c1c1-933c-49af-8e0d-4dc1b4946bfa.md)
  - this is more of the Distribution side of the equation, Ephemeralizing Data
- [The New Network Neighborhood](8905d737-8f2a-4de7-a850-c1f2b04cd45e.md)
  - this is more of the Federation side, the movement away from centralized control

stuff here also has to do with isomorphism and fungibility of representation (which can help with decentralization's keys)

There'll probably also be more anarchist philosophy type stuff

## somewhat misfiled, crashing on the couch here for now

These are thought notes that I'm not sure where they'd fit:

- [The Quest in the Quotes](73bf679b-4732-4ed1-929d-5dce9c163fd7.md)
  - high-level-meta
  - hit on a bunch of "namespace" stuff

## historical detail

(this should probably get moved into some Oral History thing around the how-i-roll's tomb history division or whatever)

There was a quest that kind of touched on a few things here (titled "wow, this is lazy"): this quest was excised, retitled, and shuffled around until it was moved and I think used as the basis for either one of the quests that are now accessible under [the Meta Note Plan Nexus][MNPN] or one of the piles of undealt-with trash that are currently in deep freeze around [Project Akira][Akira]. Anyway, its origins from here are pretty much a historical curiosity, at this point: it was never really about the subject matter explored here. Kind of weird I'm talking about it at all, really!
