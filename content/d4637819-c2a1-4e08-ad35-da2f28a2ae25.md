These pages are supposed to be mutable, though I haven't built an editing system real-time enough to make that feasible at the moment:

- [Right Now](41218b84-cd08-48a5-b91a-865e8b90c46a.md), for what I'm up to
- [News](afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md), for what I've done
- [Shopping lists](d14eeacb-1729-485a-9e76-9cceb484862f.md)

actual "scratch sheets":
