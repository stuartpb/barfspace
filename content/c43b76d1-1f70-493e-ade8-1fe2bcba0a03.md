Persistent volumes are handled by Longhorn. Here was [the "decision process" that led to Longhorn](4359d3b6-185b-40b3-8f00-64c8f1b4b528.md)

They're provided by specially-partitioned disks that are outmounted on the host. [Here was the series of deliberations around that](c617a05a-043a-4696-84c4-9a58d60f915c.md), as well as brainstorming for some possible extensions to this storage model in the future, once I've gotten a little more comfortable with PVCs / understanding Longhorn.
