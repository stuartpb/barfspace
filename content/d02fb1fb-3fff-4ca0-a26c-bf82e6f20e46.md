# The Hall of Champions

This'll be a note page where I list pages for projects / ideas that could use someone else interested in them, asking me about them, posting about them, finding other people who might want to work on them, etc.

To build this out to a generalizable structure, I've got a page for the [Request for Producers Community](49561f8d-d2d5-42b7-ac0a-d22683a1f0c3.md)
