# Pomerium and Dex

Continuing from [my prior assessment of the state of Kubernetes Auth](03f16164-12f0-48ac-9883-8923a229393a.md)

Okay, so looking at https://github.com/pomerium/pomerium-helm/tree/master/charts/pomerium, it seems like each Pomerium instance is designed to set up one model of authorization, so we'd probably want to have an "internal Pomerium" (backed by the local Dex user database, for stuff like Grafana) and an "external Pomerium" (backed by GitHub etc, for stuff like notestack services)
