# Tables, Part 1: K -> V

Tables are containers. The name "table" refers to the concept of a "table" like this:

<table>
<tr><td>foo</td><td>something</td></tr>
<tr><td>bar</td><td>something else</td></tr>
</table>

(TODO make that example reflect the actual keys/values our first table is going to look like instead)

Tables like this in programming have two columns, the first one being the Key, and the second being the Value. (Further columns are generally handled by having a *second* table as the value: we'll get to that in a moment.)

Any value can be used as a key (not counting `nil`, the absence of value)

Strings are a popular one, let's do those. (I could arguably do arrays first, but I think it works better if we introduce tables as abstract K->V and then teach how to use them for arrays - teach the general case, then a specific case. That way, minds don't get blown by "what? Arrays can't have words!")

Right here would be a convenient time to explain the string indexing syntactic sugar: in fact, I'm reconsidering that bit I wrote above about not using the syntactic sugar in the code (I think I'd rather include a comment illustrating the *long* version of the syntax, which would generally not be used, but is useful for understanding why a basic thing looks different).

Let's stash some figures in a table. (Here, I'm thinking it might make sense to have a table for, say, *the book itself*, where we use strings for which property we're setting, and for the values: I think this is what Programming in Lua itself does.)
