# Why You Gotta Fight When The Fightin's Bad

It's that "First They Came" thing.

The thing is, you really might not like the people they're fighting, and find them way scarier - but if their fight against them wins, *they will reuse that corruption on you*, because nobody has a memory to notice that this is way disproportionate. You have to show that they're using disproportionate force against you *while it's disproportionate*.

They'll look stupid if they're trying to outlaw the Communists *and* kill Charlie Chaplin.

Once compliance gets widespread, you'll stand out much more if you just stay consistent.

anyway this is just a thought on how my DSA local got so bad and got away with it
