# Primer Prime: Foreword and Introduction

(For the rest of Primer Prime, see the [Table of Contents][].)

## Foreword

I'm not sure where I learned the stuff I'm going to write here. I think it
started somewhere around Wikipedia, then spiralled off into perusing the Jargon
File, sprinkled with some loose Googling into long-forgotten 1993 home pages
and archived posts to mailing lists. Raymond Chen's blog,
[The Old New Thing][], contributed a lot to my understanding of the history of
Windows.

There's no real authority to any of this: I wasn't around for pretty much all
of the stuff I'm going to write about. Most of this is me half-remembering
things I read on the Internet somewhere and filling in the gaps with
over-simplistic interpretations and assumptions that fit the narrative I've
arbitrarily constructed.

Since I'm writing this as a text document on GitHub, if you read this and
notice that I've got something rather wrong, you can suggest an edit by
submitting a GitHub pull request, or just email me at:

## Introduction

Computers are more of a story than a science. Programming is less about
understanding complex mathematical theories than it is about knowing why people
made the weird decisions that shaped every interaction we have with computers
to this day.
