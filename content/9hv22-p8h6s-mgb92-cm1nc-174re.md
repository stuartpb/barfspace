# A tweak to Stushiba's GNOME extensions 2020-09-23

I added [Arch Linux Updates Indicator](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1010/archlinux-updates-indicator/), and I'm kinda miffed that it's right up against my clock, when I'd rather it be near the right edge, by Reboot and power control.

This is something I'd want to be able to replicate in my [Windowsystem Metabrowser](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k), but with better customizability.

[It sounds like there's a way to hack it](https://askubuntu.com/questions/453969/how-can-i-order-gnome3-shell-extensions-at-the-top), but... nah, you know?

But yeah, thinking about containerization, it'd be cool for each of these to be running its own backing store... idk. like, I guess you could get the temo stats from a Kube daemon?

anyway, papercut for GNOME
