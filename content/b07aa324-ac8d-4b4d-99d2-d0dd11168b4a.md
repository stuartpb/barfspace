# .internal certification idea

What if self-signed certificates had a special behavior in the `internal.` zone in browsers, where instead of getting a yellow setup screen, you get a blue information screen telling you that you're going to a site that is on your local network, and not an outside site (to prevent being a vector for localhost phishing attacks)

is this dumb? Is this just forgetting that you might as well have a page on .internal (or the recognized public internet) that prompts you to install the certificate for your own internal network?
