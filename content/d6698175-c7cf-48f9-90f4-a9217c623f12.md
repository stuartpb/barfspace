# Modern mDNS resolution on Arch

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved#mDNS

## understanding the /etc/resolv.conf thing

the arch wiki says there are 4 ways, and the stub is recommended.

~~that seems outdated: [the man page it links](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd-resolved.8) lists three ways, and it recommends *against* the stub, for reasons you'd expect (ie. resolution features that can't be expressed through DNS protocol).~~

oh wait that's for regular operation, the resolv.conf part is different and is documented later on in the page.

okay this is just a legacy thing that provides systemd-resolved's features via an emulated DNS layer for things that read resolv.conf and think they should implement their own resolution based on that

and okay, resolv.conf doesn't have all the complexity you'd need to specify a fully-versatile DNS configuration, it's one of those things that requires a big hairy apparatus to map to a fully-flexible model. here's my summary of the 4 modes:

- provides a dynamic stub-resolv.conf that reduces all DNS to a single server providing the full interface, and search domains for everything outside DNS
- provides just the stub DNS server and does no magic updating, meaning no search domains
- provides a dynamic
- follows resolv.conf instead of leading. resolv.conf has all the problems it's always had and won't get any of the functionality added by systemd-resolved (like, say, resolving our `.local` domains)

this really ought to be a matrix. "how you can set up networking on (Arch) Linux"

## a brief thought explaining this, and systemd in general

(note: I don't know the specifics here, this is just a common enough pattern I've seen in other places where Arch punts instead of inventing provincial distro crap, like, you know, the whole run script system)

resolv is a historical artifact from before a lot of DNS stuff had settled. it allows flexibility where you don't need it (and, indeed, where flexibility will likely introduce headaches due to consolidation around the common base), because at the time that kind of modularity was useful for extending whatever new DNS features were emerging (like mDNS)

today, that kind of expanded functionality (like DNS-over-HTTPS) needs to be widely agreed upon, and integrated into your stack properly: site-specific customizations to the common DNS base will just get you in trouble. it's a vector for bugs as parts don't get upgraded in lock-step, and it introduces overhead and slowdown and spooky action at a distance and other such crap.

this also reflects, like, every Debianism: contrast with some of the stuff I've been observing in using the PocketC.H.I.P.

## caveats about systemd-resolved

[the thing about openresolv](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Openresolv#Users) seems important. either you fix this by setting the resolv.conf-led version (in which case systemd-resolved will get those apps' changes from there), or you install `systemd-resolvconf` to route it all through the systemd-resolved model

the list of network managers this affects seems less significant than the lway that basically every VPN seems subject to this

I guess my question is: do both ways handle mDNS over a VPN?

## what about broadcasting our hostname?

is this something you need avahi for? I think so

https://linux.die.net/man/5/avahi-daemon.conf describes some of how the default system hostname gets put out there

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Avahi#Hostname_resolution

it seems like running the Avahi daemon but not including it in nsswitch.conf should be enough to prevent it being consulted for mDNS resolution?

## oh, now I understand hostname broadcast

this is handled by the network manager (ie. systemd-networkd or NetworkManager) on a per-network basis, which is right af

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved#mDNS gives the links

https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd.network.5 maps "true" to "broadcast and resolve", "resolve to "resolve but don't broadcast", and "false" to "disable mDNS"

similarly, https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/nm-settings.5 uses "no" (0) for disable, "yes" (2) for broadcast and resolve, "resolve" (1) for resolve-only, and "default" (-1) for "use whatever the globally-configured default is".

the manual notes that this requires a plugin? gonna go ahead and assume that's implicitly handled by the packager under the hood

I think I'm gonna try a default of "resolve" for both my systems, and set "broadcast" for my trusted networks. maybe even have a "trust network" script that enables any other stuff you might want to reconfigure

or, really, what I'd like to do is just set `MulticastDNS=resolve` in [resolved.conf](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/resolved.conf.5), and have the nm default fall back to that? NetworkManager's docs make it sound like that should work, but the Arch Wiki suggests it won't? and I *think* systemd-networkd would respect this value

oh, okay, looks like you'd need to do something so that systemd-networkd could enable it by default (if you want to be promiscuous like that), because [the per-link default is false](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd.network.5.en). not gonna bother learning how that works right now, except to note that [the systemd-networkd man page](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd-networkd.service.8.en) says it sets default values based on [systemd.netdev(5) files](https://jlk.fjfi.cvut.cz/arch/manpages/man/systemd.netdev.5.en)

## systemd-networkd instead of networkmanager?

https://forum.manjaro.org/t/how-to-use-systemd-networkd-to-manage-your-wifi/1557

the "needs sudo to connect to wifi" thing is kind of a bummer

## oh hey this is neat

https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Alternative_DNS_services

I knew about 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8, but I hadn't heard of Quad9 `9.9.9.9`

found on the line explaining default values on https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Systemd-resolved#Fallback

# odd thought

wow what if you extended this to be able to read DNS from etcd? this seems lighter weight than CoreDNS, might be a cool way to implement kube-dns. that would also match my dream of being able to have a home DNS server resolve .local for machines that don't have a proper implementation
