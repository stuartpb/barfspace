# Getting Something Started

Part of the [Lean Notes][] series.

[Lean Notes]: f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md

## Chapter Link: Previously

This is the first page out from the [Introduction][].

You don't need a computer to start thinking, but we're going to start dropping tools early, and at an increasingly fast pace, so if you want to use them and you don't have one already, you might want to look into [Acquiring Hardware][] first.

## Overture

This page is about going from a thought to a concept; from an idea to a plan; from a need to a vision; stuff like that.

> "We've got important work here. A lot of filing, and giving things names."

## Getting an Idea

### Protip: Think Small

Think deterministically: something you could describe in exact, mechanical terms that don't involve anything more complicated than something you've seen another site do. It doesn't matter that other sites have done similar things: what matters is that you're doing those things to *accomplish* something different or differently.

### Protip: Make something you'll use

You should be your \#1 user. If you aren't making something that *you* want, you'll never be able to understand what you should be working on.

### Spotlight: A few places people suggest ideas

On Reddit:

- https://www.reddit.com/r/CrazyIdeas/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/BigProjects/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/lightbulb/
- https://www.reddit.com/r/SomeBodyMakeThis/

## Finding What's Out There

### Protip: Keep your eyes open

When you catch a whiff of something similar to what you have in mind, be sure to write it down for a follow-up some time in the future.

### Protip: Ask around

Try to make some knowledgeable friends in real life you can ask this of. Ask your Facebook friends. Ask your Twitter followers.

Ask Reddit. (links to relevant subreddits, reiterate that asking here people suggest ideas is good)

Ask Hacker News (make a post starting with "Ask HN:" and then your question).

### Protip: Searching

When searching for something you don't know the name of:

- Try starting from the closest thing you know. Search that name plus "alternative" or "vs". (You'll often find results on the site "AlternativeTo", which is especially designed for this.)
- Try searching for the problem that thing solves.

### Spotlight: Places people post

Lifehacker, Hacker News, probably some subreddits (YouShouldKnow has a fair number of these)

## Legal considerations

### Privacy Policy / Terms of Service

Knowledge: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privacy_policy#Applicable_law

Some third parties require a privacy policy to do business with them

### Useful Tool: Drafting tools

You can also adapt a CC-licensed TOS like that of Google App Engine

### Knowledge: Licensing your code

Protip: You'll need to have something like a Contributor License Agreement if you want to accept contributions from users and still retain the right to relicense the work at some point in the future (as, otherwise, you are extending the copyright authority of the work to them, and you'll need their explicit approval to do anytihng without replacing their contibution(s) entirely).

Next up in the Table A flow: [Planning and Collaborating][]

Another thing I like to look into around this point is [Naming and Domains][].

You might also be able to solve your problem with [Codeless Solutions][].

As mentioned at the top of the page, you might need to get yourself a computer, or something else to do more of this with: [Acquiring Hardware][]

You can do more as you learn, starting with the core basics of [Computers and Phones][].
