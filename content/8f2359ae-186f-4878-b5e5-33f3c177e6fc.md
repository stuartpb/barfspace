# Messays

Mediations and Musings, in long form and shorthand quips

This is a lot of mixed-up content with a lot of legacies. (See [this page][Musings] for an oral history of how some of the original Messays were kept before this collective repo.)

[Musings]: b3a81329-fbe5-42e6-be3c-5a836c5155e7.md

Now it's just a collection of pages with more clarity in their theme:

- [The Spiral Mountain of Design and Social Psychology](458f8a16-f237-4f8e-8e17-474408732536.md) captures the spirit of the "original musings"
- [Worse Is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) collects another similar and adjacent theme
  - [This subpage](79558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) that's an intersection between those writings and [the Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), which is also sort of a Messays hub
- [Right, Secure, Robust, and Strong](4dd64124-8e20-4901-aae4-5876361adc85.md) collects some security writing that can wax messay
- [Smuggler's Cove](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md) is similarly a theme page that might start to collect thoughts
- The Messay Spoon, tavern for messays that don't fit into an existing hub yet (ie. they are Looking For Group, which is a bagtent phenomenon I should describe)
  - [Big Titles](e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md) is like a sad special room at the back of the tavern, where talent agents try to put a raiding party together from a template like The Monkees
- the [Raw page](a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md)

Complex Messays can lead into [Methods](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md) and vice versa

## The Format

Each md file should be about the size of a GitHub issue comment, one that'd be appropriate posted in many issues, and at the same time appropriate in none. They should stand alone, [like a dandelion seed forever drifting on the wind, by which we may know the universe][seed].

## Deeper Musitations

I've made a separate page collecting ideas that I figures I "could write a whole book on" (figuratively speaking), and a bunch of thoughts on their history:
