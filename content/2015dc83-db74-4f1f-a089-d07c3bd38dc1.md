# Developing Best Practices

Let's just go ahead and start collecting some thoughts here that would need to be incorporated into some kind of collected "things to keep in mind when writing barfspace Markdown"

- [x] Note that all links should repeat their symbolic references in each section (try to use a consistent ref per page though), so the section can be moved to another page smoothly
  - Example of where I needed this: the "explainer page" reference above got cut out and moved to the [Great Migration Plan][], so I had to dig around to copy it
  - This will probably be less of an issue once bagtent-rig is ready, though
  - Thoughts on a rollout of this policy are being collected on the [shit-sorting log][shitsort] as of 2019-05-03.
- [ ] Write a Best Practice about how a page should split once it's not easy to remember where any particular clause would be found in a couple seconds of scrolling on it.
  - [ ] Alternately, when you'd want to have multiple carets to keep your place with text you're inserting into one section, because you don't want to lose the position you were previously inserting to to look for or insert text in another part of the piece, it's probably time to have these passages living in different buffers that have all that kind of metadata separate.
  - "Different buffers" is probably the easiest way to describe how I work this heuristic mentally, actually.
  - This also applies to how I generally factor my writing structures, really, code and prose, not just in barfspace (though especially in barfspace).
- Actually, inline links have a lot of advantages:
  - Don't need to worry about locality.
  - Don't need to (possibly) update footnames if you change the text in a link.
  - I think there might be more notes on this lingering around somewhere, I'll just remember to direct them here or to a subpage about it at some point in the future
