# VS code markdown quibble/papercut

How do I make it continue with a list I'm typing when I start typing a new line?

And enter-enter should escape the list and unwrite any "hypothetical hyphen", which could be "faded" to illustrate that it's "untyped" until text comes after it

should also be able to control indentation before typing, that's critical

shift+tab on an "untyped list" line, at the root, should return to root context

how can this interfere with automatic-word-wrapping?

## Another quibble

It seems that VS Code recognizes `> -` as one level of indentation, not two, when drawing line continuation? That's a thing I'd like to see fixed (and, you know, maybe even rolled into a native wrap-on-save logic...)
