# An Ad for Stuart

Part of [the whole proto-Unusual-Studio consultancy project][job].

## Outline

- Who I am
- What I have to offer
- What my terms are

# Draft goes below here

I think most people have a thing in their mind they're constantly thinking about. Whether it's an app, or a website, or a story, or a little plastic widget, it's something they know they need, but have never tried to make, because they wouldn't even know how to begin.

insert here: Can be as simple as a website, could be as complicated and intricate as a whole invention with multiple mockups

I know how to begin. Over the course of the past decade, I've worked on literally hundreds of projects

I'm not like most contractors or consultants: to me, there's no way to build anything lasting than to teach, and vice versa. I don't just want to make things for you: I want to help you make them yourself.

$100 90-minute consultation (non-refundable)

My technique is far from one-size-fits-all. I never settle for just cobbling things together using the things I already know: if there's a simpler, smarter way to do it, I'll learn it, because that's what ends up paying off in the long run.

Lots of tutors will tell you that they'll train you in "the latest and greatest technology". That's bullshit. In practice, the latest technology is rarely the greatest. While I'm able to work in cutting-edge domains like 3D printing, virtual reality, and real-time communication

I don't do cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology is like a roller-coaster: it has its ups and downs, you hear a lot of screaming about them, and there's a lot of interesting engineering involved, but, ultimately, it's a lot of energy wasted on a machine that doesn't go anywhere.

# Making It Happen

(This is an earlier draft of the same kind of pitch, from the Unusual Studio workspace.)

I believe that there are a lot of people out there who have good ideas for web pages/apps that could make people's lives better, but don't have the technical knowledge to build them. I want to share my technical knowledge with people, giving them specifically the help they need to solve their most immediate, pressing questions, tailored to their specific ideas, rather than trying to fit them into a boilerplate template / framework.

Right now the missing part of this plan is having an audience, of even just a few people. If I had a few people willing to participate, here's where I'd go from there:

I'd solicit people's plans and stories, by email, Twitter, video call, or whatever. I'd want to hear their problems, and what they'd like to have to solve them, and do some initial [Muntzing][] to shave their goal down to the smallest, most-effective solution that would address their underlying problem.
