# The "Worse is Better" Collection

Here are some [messays](8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md) on a theme of "don't overplan things, don't sweat the small stuff, crap conquers all" generally known as "Worse is Better" (aka The Jersey Core)

- [My Old Bad Ideas](f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md)
- [Humans Don't Need (Much) Structure](dae875e3-bc26-4a4c-9963-89ae2137fcee.md) (My New Good Ideas)
- [Knowing Where We Have Been](3e1be44c-150f-4e88-a109-88a1ed90a56c.md)
- [Relying On and Reproducing Context](8c57e9e9-4016-4445-9dc7-4c10cf6b5854.md) (*very* sloppy, this one's pretty out-there)
- [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity](3ef0ffc5-818e-4c16-be90-0a8bd6eb8778.md), about the terrifying cognitive loop of trying to get too meta

A few more very rough reflections on the nature of [barfspace][OBRN] that used to live on the [meta page][BSMC]:

Some more, either originally listed in some other broader list or fresh and native to these post-Project-Akira notes:

## Sort of related

- [On Bad Defaults](81a3de04-98ad-4d85-a2ca-a4891efabeb2.md) talks about how relying on the defaults is a kind of "worse is better" for the user

## On Worse is Better in the Abstract Structure of the Notes

Meta reflections on barfspace in general live in [The Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), and other kinds of meta document about these notes can be found from there.

For notes that could live either here or there, there's [this joint Academy page](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) about the placement of... I think itself? It's sort of meant as a bridge between these two classes of note, and reflecting on the nature of such bridges

(per the note I just added on that page, said junction should be listed higher here, so ideas with that context in mind can find that gathering point more easily)
