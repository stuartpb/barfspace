# I'd Turn Back If I Were You

I've been thinking about this game for a while, based on a thread on Twitter a while back about a game where you're the mysterious old ferryman trying to stop the intrepid young hero on his quest.

Back in the day, Skipper Stan and his trusty first mate Chipper Dan quested to find the cursed eldritch horror at the center of the island, and it exacted a terrible cost: Chipper Dan was trapped eternally in the Phantom Zone or something, and Skipper Stan was cursed to never let another explorer make it to the island

## Mechanics

The whole game would be about cooldowns and burn timers, with a branching course to the island (sort of like the old Jungle Cruise VR)

Trips to the island take a fixed amount of time for each pathway.

The quest would be about how you get them to chicken out and turn around, or go to a different island, or just jump overboard

## Influences

That part of The Ring where the horse jumps off the ferry

## throwaway ideas

Skipper Stan's archnemesis is the jailor man and Sailor Sam.

The Dana-to-Venkman exchange from Ghostbusters, but it's "You remind me of a used boat salesman."

## Seasons

First season would ramp up to an epic demon hunter and/or someone looking to remove their own horrible curse.

Skipper Stan agrees to swap curses with the guy at the end of Season 1, and then we see how Season 2 starts: he awakes on a crashing plane, and one person remarks that he's not Clyde, what just happened, and shoots him in the head... at which point, he awakens again, and the scene repeats

the whole "first episode" of the next season is just figuring out how to not get shot in the head in three seconds

meanwhile, there's a "gaiden season" of Clyde trying to be Skipper Stan without any of the lore
