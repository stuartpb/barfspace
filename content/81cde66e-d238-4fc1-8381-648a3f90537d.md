# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose kind of overarching contexts that are constantly shifting.

## Noteball Administratum

To read some notes that may suggest the nature of these shifts and contexts:

- the [Department of Discord](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md), the headquarters for content work in these notes
- the [Oozy Sewer](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) is a project specifically about studying emergent behaviors
- the [Tavern of Meta in Total](8c5a1d30-97d9-4395-85be-b6c8ba57b239.md) serves as a sort of ultimate tavern/index for this kind of meta note.
- the [Historium of the Notegraph](c4ab1f6b-cac2-4025-ae27-3b82f0a9d4c6.md)
- the [Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md)
  - the [Shadow Curtain](e50eb50f-cc83-43b5-888a-d2ae77daf8a5.md)
- the [Academy of Belfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md)
- the [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md)
  - the [bagtent index](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) managed there

## Scratch zone

These pages are supposed to be mutable, though I haven't built an editing system real-time enough to make that feasible at the moment:

- [Right Now](41218b84-cd08-48a5-b91a-865e8b90c46a.md), for what I'm up to
- [News](afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md), for what I've done
- [Shopping lists](d14eeacb-1729-485a-9e76-9cceb484862f.md)

actual "scratch sheets":

- [May 20 jam session](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md)

## The Journals

  - a loose tavern for miscellaneous categories of thought

## More freeform / creative-writing-type stuff

much of which dates back to the pre-bagtent era of [barfspace](7f9a66a0-38fc-49e0-8489-270cdd3036ee.md)

- [Messays](8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md) - a couple main strains under it are listed here:
  - [Design Thoughts](458f8a16-f237-4f8e-8e17-474408732536.md)
  - [Big Titles](e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md)
    -  a kind of incubator for messay clusters
- [Mad Natter](e1cae26c-3271-48ac-aa0c-a085fa4aa211.md)
  - for silly shitposts
- [Raw notes](a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md)
  - a safe space for jotting down thoughts that are moody and personal

## Theme collectors

These are pages that stand for ideas that I can best/only express by collecting links (internal or external) to things that go into a facet or sibling of the idea

- [Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md)
- [Ruinous Reification](7aecb2c6-18e8-4967-9447-e743ebc003ec.md)

## Jailer's Cays

These are an odd series of notes with a similar "vibe" that I can't quite define beyond a generally Spider-Skull-Island type theme

- [Security Island](4dd64124-8e20-4901-aae4-5876361adc85.md)
- [Smuggler's Cove](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md)
- [Anarchy Headquarters](c47c2afa-59e0-4cde-a5b5-6afe4509ac46.md)
- [Signatory Conclave](64a52921-8c92-40bb-a0e5-16414cc96d18.md))

## Fiction and dramatization

- [Pitches and Scripts](b297a6f8-5646-4ce1-9be1-d7ed6056a513.md)
  - for story premises, character study, dialogue bits, things like that
  - this is really a kind of big subsection of the notes, really
  - the page will probably turn into a Tavern for ideas that don't cleanly fall between the new halves
  - ["Original" premises](a8a866de-058d-4729-86f0-57088d744e28.md)
  - ["Derivative" work](bf409581-d752-437a-a086-60002a0f6889.md)

## Link stashes

Here are some pages that just collect links to stuff so I don't forget it (and an [index page][metalinks] for linkdumps that aren't top-level like these).

- [Stuff I Have Read](2593b86b-8504-4c6e-af09-501c6a54ef67.md)
- [Tweet Stash](81cc029a-560f-4476-8f89-821f5b522e04.md)
- [Finds from Hacker News](93c07255-53aa-4f1c-aa32-ac48149b9683.md)
- [Hackaday](bbc37ad7-5776-4b30-abf9-396639d1b1a8.md)
- [Reblogs](6c92c19f-c4de-4c83-a004-4a57fd0f76af.md)
- [Spiritual Siblings](33adc43b-8996-4449-87d0-134c91c691e5.md), Other Trees of Notes Like These
- [Wikipedia finds](c3b016fe-8f41-4a19-a1a7-5f99f22f10db.md)
- [Miscellaneous GitHub Finds](fe86724d-ba86-404c-8745-82e7dd53635b.md)
- [A Series of YouTubes](321cb285-46e9-489b-a194-dab70d646d2c.md)

[metalinks]: 0f18ba9f-dc5f-4b1a-a5da-50d09ce3e9d3.md

TODO: Comb through things like my GitHub stars and Tabalanche tabs, like, weekly? And recap them here

## Reactions

[The Tasteland][Tastes] is a branch of the notes where I'm keeping reviews and things like that

[Tastes]: 6661cd90-c9a6-4f7a-97cc-3eb47f9dee2e.md

## Lean Notes

[Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md) is the term describing a big chunk of my notes that's dedicated to exploring and documenting how stuff can be put together.

[Zero to Software](852d9a19-6801-4236-8cfa-3eab81aeec3c.md), the original set of notes, has a lot of its current content in a bunch of Trello boards that haven't been copied here, and a lot of those Trello boards aren't even full of all that much content themselves.

[Everybody Gets a Factory](8cbd867d-1a63-4d1f-9c83-cab019fe87bd.md) is a more recently-worked-with body of notes on the general "maker" sphere.

[Understanding Lua](ea6e4e03-acb8-46ea-9024-4333e363ee60.md) is kind of like Lean Notes, but instead, it's a draft for a graphic-novel-style introduction to key programming concepts through Lua.

## Miscellanea

Here's the long tail of where notes that don't easily fit in any of the cleaner buckets above fall:

- [The Rest](fd071a93-8373-4adc-84c6-ae781c7d0442.md)
  - for when I really, really, really don't want to classify something as any of the above
  - [Weird Stubs](231786d3-4a9b-4451-9df1-e2049b90b0fe.md), for other pages needing more love
- [Taverns and Commissaries](d4d2fdbe-4cea-4de0-aa53-90646d3d5346.md), an index of pages where loose pages gather
- [Loose Notes](ff47c3c8-6686-4225-ba27-23f61c604e0d.md): The Last Appendix
  - for ideas that don't even warrant their own page, and don't already have a suitable appendix page I can figure out right when I need to start writing them
  - I can tear them off and give them pages (possibly sorted, even) or move them to an Appendix later.
