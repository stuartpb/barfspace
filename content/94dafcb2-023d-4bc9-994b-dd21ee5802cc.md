reminder that all my ideas around this live in [3D Printer Upgrades](0b49c0ed-b327-4005-879e-59762d3af2b5.md) right now

## Socks

Stuff like [these](https://e3d-online.com/v6-socks-pro-pack-of-3)

These prevent prints from failing by way of the plastic collecting all over your print head. It's a really good idea.

On the other hand, they get in the way of cooling, which can have its own set of problems. (IIRC there's a thing about this in the Upgrades - bigger fan spout or whatever.)
