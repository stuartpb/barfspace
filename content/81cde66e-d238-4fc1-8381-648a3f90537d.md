# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose kind of overarching contexts that are constantly shifting, but this README is kind of cool for it now:

## Plans and check-ins

this was IIRC born in the reworked [barfspace][]

- [Right Now][], the successor to my Planfile
- [Quests][], which has kind of turned into my "To Do" lists
- [News][], the flip side of recording ephemeral state
- [Project ideas][projects]

There's also [this page][GYST], which kind of covers the current state of the repository, and what I'm planning to do to clean it up. (It'll probably get worked into one of these nodes soon - or a better "meta" list will work its way onto here.)

## Other facets of my life right now

- [The Left Side of the Notes][fyidust]
- [Unusual Studio, Kind Of][job]
- [Wedding Plans][Wedding]

## Lean Notes

a series of notes sharing my expertise in various fields (here's [its original README][Lean Notes]) which I tried to pursue across two orders:

- [Table A][]
- [Table B][]

Note that there are a couple more pages listed on the Lean Notes page that aren't listed on either of these tables.

There's also [this page][layout], which describes the overall layout of files in this repository (beyond the `content` directory), which was originally written on-the-fly when I was coming up with the structure for Lean Notes that would eventually turn into this repository (through applying the same structure to [barfspace][] and merging).

## More freeform / creative-writing-type stuff

much of which dates back to the pre-bagtent era of [barfspace][]

- [Meditations and Musings][MnMs], which is sort of a catch-all for standalone pages in these notes that have some kind of philosophical or pragmatic topic
- [the barfspace meta collection][meta], containing files that were kept separate in a directory called "docs" back when most of the content lived in named files at the root (which eventually found their way back to Meditations and Musings).
  - That docs/ directory, if you trace its lineage, was originally borne out moving a bunch of musings that had been specifically prompted by the project itself out of the "main" namespace. It's kind of a legacy artifcat, really.
- [Raw emotional stuff][raw] - for when it's like that, but it's *way* less easy to articulate cleanly
- [Silly shit][tumblr], for shitposts
- [Pitches and Scripts][], for story premises, character study, dialogue bits, things like that - this is really a kind of big subsection of the notes, really.

## Miscellanea

- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air][FBBA], a Discordian rite within the larger Chaos
- [Appendices][], single-document clearinghouses for various bite-sized thoughts
- [The Rest][]: for when I really, really, really don't want to classify something as any of the above
- [Loose Notes][]: for ideas that don't even warrant their own page, and don't already have a suitable appendix page I can figure out right when I need to start writing them. I can tear them off and give them pages (possibly sorted, even) or move them to an Appendix later.
