# Draft goes below here

I think most people have a thing in their mind they're constantly thinking about. Whether it's an app, or a website, or a story, or a little plastic widget, it's something they know they need, but have never tried to make, because they wouldn't even know how to begin.

I know how to begin. Over the course of the past decade, I've worked on literally hundreds of projects

I'm not like most contractors or consultants: to me, there's no way to build anything lasting than to teach, and vice versa. I don't just want to make things for you: I want to help you make them yourself.

$100 90-minute consultation (non-refundable)

My technique is far from one-size-fits-all. I never settle for just cobbling things together using the things I already know: if there's a simpler, smarter way to do it, I'll learn it, because that's what ends up paying off in the long run.

Lots of tutors will tell you that they'll train you in "the latest and greatest technology". That's bullshit. In practice, the latest technology is rarely the greatest. While I'm able to work in cutting-edge domains like 3D printing, virtual reality, and real-time communication

I don't do cryptocurrency. Blockchain technology is like a roller-coaster: you hear a lot of screaming about it, it has its ups and downs, and there's a lot of interesting engineering involved, but, ultimately, it doesn't take you anywhere.

$100/hr (flexible)
