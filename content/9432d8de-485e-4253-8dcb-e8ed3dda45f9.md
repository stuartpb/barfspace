# bagtent braindump 2018

this page aggregates concepts that were originally written in a mishmash brainstorm for [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md)

it's pretty much just a historical artifact at this point (for retrieving context to understand these disjoint writings) - see the bagtent index proper for a better-structured tree

  - [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md), if there isn't already a page about it (History Force? Understanding Lua's meta notes?)
  - This should maybe be looped in with The Organic Junction so they can inform each other
