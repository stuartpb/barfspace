# Maker Pursuits

These are some projects I'm working on with components that can't just be downloaded to any old Linux system, like 3D printed stuff.

For notes on 3D printing in general, check out [Adventures in 3D Printing][A3DP]

## Project ideas without their own page

- quizbus, a dead-simple relay-based independent-client-controller-circuit that just has all clients share a line with unlimited players allowed
  - you could even have WS2812s on the "light" line
  - oh man, could you cheat at this by making a controller that only buzzes in when it detects someone else is about to (in a way that could lock them out)?
  - maybe there needs to be a "fairness test" mode to see that the controller operates correctly, and has no special parts (like an ESP8266 and a gyro that makes it only cheat at certain angles)
  - oh man, they could be like QI buttons
