# CBGBism

Often, all you need is a place that a pressure can go, even if it's not a clean fit

examples:

- CBGB
- Linux
- Craigslist
- Rolling Stone (re Hunter S. Thompson, etc)
- Roger Corman films, for learning the ropes of Hollywood

What many (if not most) of these flashpoints had in common was a very low barrier to entry - there was no "nah, you're not an appropriate band for CBGB" bar to clear.
