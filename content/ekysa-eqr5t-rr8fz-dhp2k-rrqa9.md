Because it's a (Pop)corn C.H.I.P.

If it's pin-compatible, shouldn't it fit into the same chassis as the PocketC.H.I.P.?

What upgrades would we want?

- Speakers would be cool
- LEDs are cool but I'd really want at least 1 per key
- Maybe give people traces to cut (that can be re-bridged) to hijack the dome switches for something like a Cherry upgrade
  - smarter: could it be done by making it so the domes could be ignored by a bridge/short?
    - I'm thinking, like, a surface-mounted contact-based keyboard upgrade
      - in fact, that's probably the smartest way to design this: have the dome sitches by default, but there's one gap you can bridge to disable the domes and provide your own switches in whatever compatible configuration
        - and so you could use this to implement a WS2812-based switch array?
          - I kind of need to see how the PocketC.H.I.P.'s natural key array worked
