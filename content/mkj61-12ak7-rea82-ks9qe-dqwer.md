# Inlining Links in Bagtent

This resolved the historic issue that led to the recommendation to [keep all footlinks as close to their reference as possible](rmb77-qdmnq-828jq-ba8fx-xbe8k).

One of the places where inline links definitely make more sense is for lists, where moving items from page to page doesn't require moving multiple pieces of data.

[Inline Rock](t2m2g-73fjy-r58h9-406ky-mz9re) collects the shifts that led to this becoming the standard.

This might have been an idea about how those references wouldn't need to be trucked around manually, but... why rely on the tooling to do this for you? you're *already* seeing what a pain in the ass this is when you don't have it. One of the principles of [Worse is Better](hp3rj-bp2vq-059k3-ge144-a3tcv) is that you should design around the things that are the least pain in the ass with the broadest range of MacGyver-like circumstances

[this note](h3jma-ap4ef-01a3j-hfdjq-d31jq) documents some of the things I was thinking I would do with footlinks initially, which may explain why I was hesitant to move away frmo them for so long.
