# The Current Report of Broken Notes

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the current nexus for my base of operations under the [Department of Development][DoD]. Update your bookmarks.

2019-05-07: Making a note here that I should revisit the Project Akira Great Notes Consolidation page to reflect on its thoughts as they pertain to how the issues I was writing about then have evolved and are evolving.

EXAMPLE, 2019-05-28: As far as I know, there's *still* no "oral history" page explaining my best recollection of the meditations -> barfspace / Lean Notes / how-i-roll -> notes.stuartpb.com trajectory. the [old smaller Barfspace root][OBR], and the history page linked there, kind of come close, but they don't continue to explain the merge well enough. in fact, now that I reread it, I can see that that page is currently stashing a few more links to the past artifacts... maybe that'll just be what that page goes on to be, a "museum"

but, argh, I guess what it is is that... argh. I keep going "oh, it can be where I jot down loose memories to explain things I started doing!" but, like, the thing is... these notes are self-hosting now, I do it live, there will never be another artifact like that one, they'll all be in journal form now

anything that notes the repo history will need to list that there was a second Great Uncertainty when I went to the destructuring because the interconnected markdown was more complicated and I didn't want to commit broken Markdown - that ended up being kind of a lost cause, but nonetheless we march forward

ALSO, [petlogs should get merged into these notes][petloggins] (I believe this is now tracked elsewhere, so this line can probably get cut)

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]

Most of the stuff on this page that was still relevant has been packed up and moved to [Barfspace Operations][] - it's currently just become a historical landmark as "The Triage Site", where it was used to refer to the kind of legacy work Operations was meant to cover (it should really be renamed "Ongoing Legacy Quests")
