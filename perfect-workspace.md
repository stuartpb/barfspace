# My Perfect Workspace World

The thing that I want - all I want out of the world (as far as having room to experiment with software goes) - I mean, really, my perfect human experience looks like:

- Universal basic income (of the "income plus" variety where other basic needs like healthcare are also provided by the state)
- Free virtual machines for anybody whose work is robustly open source (ie. following [SACRED][] principles).

I like the idea of the CNCF cluster, but it's too heavily gatekept right now

Like, the core of this is that, like, the "free VMs" thing... it should apply to *everyone*, whether they're an active contributor or just an "idle consumer" who basically only pulls other people's changes. So long as they're not using the VM for *proprietary development*, it should be free, because this allows for the *real* thing open source projects need: *an interested and engaged user base*.

And I'm emphatic about the "the only restriction is if the development is proprietary" thing. Like, people should be allowed to use this for, like... private Minecraft servers (so long as all the extensions in use are public, and their use is documented), and personal photo storage, and everything.

In short: **cluster computing should be a public utility**, one whose only restriction is that it can't be used for private *endeavors*, where an "endeavor" is quantified as "anything that could be of benefit to the general public".
