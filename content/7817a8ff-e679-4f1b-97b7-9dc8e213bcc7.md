# Dumping the RCA Voyager Pro through Stushiba

After [getting to know SP Flash Tool on Stuzzy](b69a3ad7-36c6-456c-a39a-a40cf71d8928.md), I started sshd on stuzzy (sudo systemctl start sshd`) and copied all the work I'd done over to Stushiba by logging in via ssh (I used password auth because I haven't set up keys, though I really should)

## once I got it working

After a few tests pulling 256M sections, then pulling a whole gig and doing something like `cat ROM_*.bin | cmp -l ROM_0-big.bin` with the merged version, I determined I could get the on-board ROM as easily as running SP Flash Tool's Readback function 15 times, advancing the address by 1 GiB (0x40000000) each time

the size was 0x40000000 each time except the last, from address 0x380000000, when it had to be reduced to 0x1d000000 (the device's total "UA", which I think is "usable area", being 0x39d000000, per the EMMC info on the sidebar on the left)

as I was trying to get the device layout, I tried [mucking around with Windows-only tools](b4693a8a-8ecd-4165-a3ef-f61d9144a1db.md) that I'd found posts about using, but after I ended up finding [a description of the scatter file layout in the onboard recovery log](6c94eb4b-ce94-407c-ab64-fe871e4992ce.md) I abandoned that altogether

the real action continues in [manipulating the dumps on stushiba](8ba3972c-ab5d-4724-ae52-c6ec001b48ac.md)
