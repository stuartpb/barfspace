# Popcorn Time type thing

## pitch?

You could really make an interesting system that interfaces with both a big database (maybe a film+tv database, which it uses for search suggestions as title+year) and a magnet tracker like tpb or some Dat list (using dumps as its backing store, I guess), and torrents in progress

also, season/episode schedules for "sXXeYY" suggestion on tv shows

also, a set of dropdowns for tags like resolution, BRRip/Webrip, stuff like that

you could even have a dropdown for "trusted handles" for usernames you want to search for

## other listed features

- video transcoding + streaming
- metadata
- auto-fetch?

## auto-thumbnailing

kind of like Mame frontends, display images like "poster.jpg" first

you could have a blacklist (adblock-style, even) to block "signature" images, for display if not download, both by content and filename pattern match
