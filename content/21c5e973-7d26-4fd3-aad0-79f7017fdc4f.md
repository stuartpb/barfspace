# A More Diverse Spaceship Earth

## Basis

Spaceship Earth is cute and all, but its last bastion of "progress" was accepting that black people existed in 1970, and that the Middle East wasn't *all* bad.

## Narrator

I love Judi Dench, and Jeremy Irons, and everyone who's narrated Spaceship Earth over the years.

Invent an AI that can sound like all of them.

Ideally, you'd even be able to open to the air altogether.

But so, like, you'd still have the Burning of Alexandria. bu
