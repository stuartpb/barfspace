# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose "grand projects" that will or will not blend together over time:

- [Lean Notes][] and [barfspace][], which are kind of the same thing, but one's more structured than the other
  - I'm planning to sort of mesh these two together more over time
  - Leaving a reminder for myself here that merging this in introduced three orphan files to the repo that should be ameliorated
  - I *think* those orphans have been addressed?
  - Anyway, those two nodes should be merged back into this one, and then they'll live as stumps or whatever
- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air][FBBA], a Discordian rite within the larger Chaos
- [Pitches and Scripts][], a repo I've decided to merge in piece by uncommitted piece instead of going all Lean Notes with it
- [The Left Side of the Notes][fyidust]
- [Operation: Job][job]

## Also

[my-old-bad-ideas.md][], which has a lineage dating back to when these files actually had *names*, is currently home base for merging a bunch of further projects into this one.
