# ESP8266 Emulation

## Emulating an ESP8266

- [Web-based?](https://www.quora.com/Are-there-any-online-ESP8266-Arduino-simulators-like-the-NodeMCU-Arduino)
- [QEMU?](https://www.esp8266.com/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=26) is that how the SDK does it?

I'd like to see an emulator that also emulates, you know, LEDs and screens.

This starts to get into circuit simulation, which is a thing? Do I have notes on it?

Noting here that Shenzhen I/O and the Abstract Pipeline / Blockly thing both kind of overlap?

anyway this was all from googling "nodemcu emulator"

## Emulating NodeMCU specifically

This doesn't necessarily take an ESP8266 - you could make a simulated environment locally.

- Someone did it [in Java](https://github.com/jcrygier/NodeMCUSimulator), which, yikes, but OK

## Emulating things on an ESP8266

This part in particular overlaps with the [Emulation Notes](5f300d2c-da81-4124-8e4f-480bd4e2b552.md)
