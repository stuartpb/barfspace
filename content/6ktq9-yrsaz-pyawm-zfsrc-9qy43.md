# Did Francis Bacon Secretly Invent Alphabinary To Be William Shakespeare?

This hypothesis is pretty much posed as a joke, on how Francis Bacon's love of
cyphers has fueled speculation that William Shakespeare's works contain hidden
messages about having been secretly been written by Francis Bacon, by
interpreting all of Shakespeare's works as alphabinary, then seeing if the
alphabinary values of the letters correspond to words encoded in a Bacon cipher.

## Classical vs. Modern Cipher / Alphabet

The alphabet against which Bacon described his original cipher was an older
alphabet, missing

For alphabinarization, this doesn't make a difference, as the midpoint of both
alphabets is the same

### "Omnia per omnia"

This was the only word I could find that was distinctly associated with Francis Bacon: http://cryptiana.web.fc2.com/code/bacon_e.htm

"O-M-N-I-A per omnia" in Henry IV, Part 1, Act 5, Scene 4:

      01 0110 10 101101100010  0000 000 11 001 1011
      My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
         \___./\.___/\___/\__.._/\_.__/
         | O  || M  || N ||  I  ||  A |
         /+++'\/'+++\/+++\/++''+\/+'++\
      ab abba ba babbabbaaaba  aaaa aaa bb aab babb
      01 0110 10 101101100010  0000 000 11 001 1011
         |||| /| ////|||||\\\  //|| ///

         abbab ababb abbaa abaaa aaaaa
         01101 01011 01100 01000 00000

When you get right down to it, this is more of a coincidence with "Lord of
Westmoreland" being the right 18 bits to be the first letters of "OMN" and the
first three of "I", with the remaining seven zeroes of "lead him" being one of
the more common seven-bit sequences (all letters being in the first half of the
alphabet).
