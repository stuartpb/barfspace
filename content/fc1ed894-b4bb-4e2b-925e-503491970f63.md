# vr peripheral idea

What if it's just a giant touchpad, like the size of a tablet?

great for maps: you can expand the map to be fifty feet wide, you just can only interact with it touch-wise (without hand trackers)

shit, this could rock for teleportation

I mean, you can kind of interface this with Knuckles, but

hmm, a stylus would only need an IMU, wouldn't it, you could get Lighthouse data from the tablet surface, though I guess Logitech's thing makes sense for in-air UI

shit, can an ESP8266 or ESP32 interface with Lighthouse tracking?

anyway, the idea is that this could be useful for, you know, Swype-style typing, or Dasher-style even

ooh, an idea for 3D Dasher: the more you push in / pull out, the more/less bias it presents in predictive text versus any-letter
