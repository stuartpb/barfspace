# Trying out Buildah on Stushiba

Found https://github.com/containers/buildah via https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora-coreos/faq/#_what_happens_to_project_atomic (which I found through Cockpit, which I think I found through, like, core-server recommending Cockpit plus VMs for provisioning multiple instances)

Anyway, I'm thinking this could be nice for some initial experimentation with images for my cluster

I see there's [a build for Arch](https://github.com/containers/buildah/blob/master/install.md#arch-linux)

`yay -S buildah`
