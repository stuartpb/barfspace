`sudo pacman -Syu`, which [has caused a problem](https://archlinuxarm.org/forum/viewtopic.php?f=60&t=11670) (see https://github.com/justmoon/node-bignum/issues/98)

installed bluez-utils, enabled bluetooth.service

installed blueman

paired with stuffed elephant

refiddled with all that stuff mentioned around when I originally enabled speakers (somehow they'd re-muted), plus a bunch of of other channels I also unmuted that sounded like they might matter

installed pavucontrol which I really should have done much earlier

also installed bluez-firmware even though I'm pretty sure that doesn't do anything

followed the directions in https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Bluetooth_headset#Headset_via_Bluez5.2FPulseAudio in pavucontrol, reloaded the chrome tab I was experimenting with, and got it to work

installed firefox, festival, espeak, speech-dispatcher, sox, libmad, opusfile
