# Irrigating Streams of Consciousness with Headings

(originally titled "barf then cleanup" which, yeah, is terrible, but not fussing about the title when making the page let me write the next four paragraphs)

okay so I wanted to make a note about a strategy I write notes with sometimes, under the general tactical list of "worse is better"

you just write line after line trying to go down all the side passages and wonderings that come up, you know

everything that was close-enough to what it is you wanted to write about

then, as you, you know, remember stuff you wrote before, go find it, as you start to notice how parts of what you're writing would be relevant to other pages, you go up the page, and you start sectioning the stream of consciousness into headings

this lets you summarize and better-index the thoughts on the page, as you revisit it in the linking process immediately, as well as in the future. Like, it's just an excellent margin-note-like construct that helps everything immediately.

## I made this heading after going away for a bit and coming back

(so they don't all always need to be addred retroactively)

sometimes you'll find that you've gone down a level of focus, once you've made a few headings for a few brief paragraphs, you write a page that's all on a facet of the broad topics your previous paragraphs covered.
