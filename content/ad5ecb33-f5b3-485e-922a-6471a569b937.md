# loose idea for speculative fiction premises and concepts

here's a pitch for where no civilization will ever be anything more than pen pals. as I described just now [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/1126644109538500608):

> I had an idea a while back for an "interstellar civilization" that would entail various parts of the universe coming into contact exclusively through beacons that take trillions of years to travel between them, following wormholes that go back in time to make comms instantaneous-
>
> but since only matter with very specific properties can last several times longer than the lifespan of the universe, these beacons are the civilizations' only means to reach each other - no planetary species has ever found another species on a planet physically-reachable in time.

some more thoughts: this is the missing component to the Drake Equation: every civilization that isn't in wormhole range, if it exists, is completely unreachable

what if some civilizations have loops, and some don't? so, like, for the purposes of this exercise wormholes are one-way, but space is two-way, so some locations have a way to make it back through a wormhole that goes space-close enough - and I guess your planet has to be in one of those? and this... can extend to anywhere in the physically-reachable
