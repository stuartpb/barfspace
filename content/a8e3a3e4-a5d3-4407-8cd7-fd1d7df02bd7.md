# borkflowy markdown reader

It's like Workflowy, but with Bagtent as a backing store

So the central idea is, you'd be able to click and expand any link, and it'll expand immediately after the paragraph / list item by insertion (so basically, this is an alternative to breadcrumb navigation, where it's "accordion nvaigation")

and to fuck with links, you can press the button, and any "innermost" expansion can be edited as raw Markdown

this is sort of one offshoot of an idea that I originally conceptualized as "boxesin", the other one is [over here][]

## link suggestion dropdown

(originally a blip in [the big bagtent braindump][dump] - this seems to be the context where it fits in best)

I'm also thinking, like, every time there's a list and a link, do the search thing, and have "create (literal symbol)" as an option at the end to create a new page, which is inline-inserted

maybe have an extension that lets you open a new document (with a link to the current page or whatever) and works like the bagtent-sprout script, in that you have to pick a document to add it to (from a dropdown that sorts by pages with most inter-content links)

like, the thought I'm having right here, is, like, when there's an xkcd I like to pull out a lot, I can just type the name I usually use for it, and bam presto, there it is
