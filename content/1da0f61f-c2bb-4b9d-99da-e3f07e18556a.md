# How I am Currently Trying to Sort My Shit Out

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the current nexus for my base of operations under the [Department of Development][DoD]. Update your bookmarks.

Right now, I just did a bunch of the "reconciling Lean Notes with the rest of the repo" work I'd been wanting to do, moving links around.

I kind of want to get back to the whole Lean Notes project proper, now that it lives here.

Past that, I want to sort out what the hell is going on with my "Right Now" and "Projects" indices: like, I feel like those could probably get woven together better.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]

I want to explain that Google Keep is a huge supplement to this repo, somewhere. I think there's a note about me needing to explain my note-taking process somewhere around here - I'll probably work on that, at some point.

## Update 2019-03-08

So, I'm thinking of moving this repo over to GitLab Pages, and writing my own rendering system.

One thing I'm thinking it'd be cool to add, if I could have my own system for this - so, one of the major perks of doing this would be that I'd get to do my own pug-based template renderer or whatever.

But another thing I'm thinking could be fun would be an "add these stylesheets for these pages" spec, like "everything linked from one of the two Lean Notes pages shoyld have this Lean Notes stylesheet". Kind of like the special rules around creating trees for notes that live somewhere around the plans for Bell TPC in the Unconvincing Truth notes.
