# Style for Punctuation

there's a sort of "implicit semicolon" at the end of an unpunctuated line in English

(the funny thing is that a period has the opposite meaning in terms of "continuation" relative to a semicolon in JS, but that's neither here nor there)

But yeah, this is not only why it's important to not punctuate your thoughts in English when typing in a chat / notes environment, but why it *is* important to punctuate them at the end of sentences that form a complete thought, like this one.

## Other thoughts on punctuation

- I believe there was a similar thought in my Manual of Style, whenever that gets imported.
- Some editorial conventions just boil down to Spelling
