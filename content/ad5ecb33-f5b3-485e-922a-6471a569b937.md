# Bottled Messages Across Lonely Islands

(title idea [from this tweet](https://twitter.com/mcnees/status/1195735502617485313))

here's a pitch for where no civilization will ever be anything more than pen pals. as I described just now [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/1126644109538500608):

> I had an idea a while back for an "interstellar civilization" that would entail various parts of the universe coming into contact exclusively through beacons that take trillions of years to travel between them, following wormholes that go back in time to make comms instantaneous-
>
> but since only matter with very specific properties can last several times longer than the lifespan of the universe, these beacons are the civilizations' only means to reach each other - no planetary species has ever found another species on a planet physically-reachable in time.

some more thoughts: this is the missing component to the Drake Equation: every civilization that isn't in wormhole range, if it exists, is completely unreachable

what if some civilizations have loops, and some don't? so, like, for the purposes of this exercise wormholes are one-way, but space is two-way, so some locations have a way to make it back through a wormhole that goes space-close enough - and I guess your planet has to be in one of those? and this... can extend to anywhere in the physically-reachable

also, this can be a fun twist on making the Dark Forest scenario bleaker: the civilizations are safe from each other because it's almost impossible to make *anything* that can survive interstellar travel over the spacetime necessary. moving parts wear out, only the beacons are solid state (and maybe just outright small, like getting a baseball-sized piece of matter requires a nuclear blast's worth of force to penetrate to an acceptable distance)

## oh hey

Turns out this is the one thing I ever posted to Tumblr, Septermber 18 2014, in a post entitled "FTL travel by way of time travel":

> Sci-fi premise idea: Humanity validates the existence of wormholes and explores them via impervious, self-powering drones capable of traveling at speeds of c(1-1e-15) or so. These drones enter a wormhole, come out the other end, then navigate to either the next nearest wormhole or, if within the known Universe, a rally point in the approximate vicinity of Earth, at which point they transfer their data to whatever machine is there (either a server, if arriving after the dawn of humanity, or the last drone to arrive that that spot, if this drone has not reached the earliest reachable space-time location).
>
> Humanity then uses algorithms to route courses at the same near-light speed, which will jump through the nearest wormhole that exits to a time millennia before your scheduled arrival time (so you can travel at a time-dilated speed that will bring you there at the desired time).
