following [these](https://winaero.com/blog/reset-windows-10-password-without-using-third-party-tools/) directions

loaded the hive and about to restart.

to confirm: the next steps are gonna be to run "net user", then "net user login new_password" where "login" is the username and "new_password" is the new password (so if my username is "blerp" and I want to make my password "derp" the command is "net user blerp derp")
