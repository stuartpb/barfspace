# Learning Journeys

Notes I make as I explore various technologies.

Kind of dovetails with [Lean Notes][], in a way, though Lean Notes tends to slice by aspect, and this tends to slice by technology (though I expect those lines to blur going forward).

[Lean Notes]: f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md

[Data and Reference Sheets](3823093b-64d3-43f8-ab26-853d39123d90.md) tracks various pieces of information that I've collected (or found).

[Software Technical Research](e4f7fc4a-7242-45e0-8631-7586727fa1e9.md) lists notes exploring "soft" technologies

[Maker Journeys](cd84567a-5cb9-43e8-85b0-bfe39960655a.md) explores more "hard" technology (like plastic and steel).

## Thoughts

This is pretty much misfiled, but it's adjacent in that it's collecting "resources I've found that have tips on a thing, as well as my opinions":

- [Object-Oriented Programming](ae6b4e9f-4b19-4734-89cd-b3899ad05f6d.md)

Maybe this should go to The Tasteland, or Rants? (Or, hell, both?)

You know, that initial description sounded a lot like Lean Notes, but this is a little too far in detail to hit Lean Notes.

This section is currently demonstrating "I'll Just Put This Here" carveout in action

## Possible ways for this page to evolve

It might make sense to have this devolve into a page linking off to more subject-oriented pages, where I have a "Journals-like section" for pages where Log links and understandings Journals-style. (This is happening now, kind of - we'll see how "sectional" the Journal sections get, and I'm not sure I'm breaking at the right level at the moment. Might need to get more subject-and-tavern-y: maybe just as the number of researched topics gets further bigger.)

There can also be an Academy-of-Barfspace-owned page exploring the Journals structure, like the one exploring Quests.
