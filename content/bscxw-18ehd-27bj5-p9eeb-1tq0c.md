# Bitwise Random Dice

## Generating 4 bits

Roll 1d8. If the number you read is "upside down" relative to your eyes or dominant hand, add 8.

## The Double-D8 design

The left side of the triangular has the digit: the "pointing up" direction is white (or the reverse, if you want)

The other D8 has a "white A/I/O/U" and a "black A/I/O/U". You read whichever consonant on the left D8

You can also list their conventional hex/dec digits on the consonant die

## Generating 5 bits

(since we can't trust a D32 the way we can 2 Platonic solids)

Roll 1d20 and 1d12. Pick whichever die lands closest to your eyes, with your dominant hand as a tiebreaker. (If the D12 is numbered 1-12, add 20.)

Truncated Icosahedron maybe?

## "D32" face numbering

[1/32, 4/29, 7/26, 10/23, 13/20, 16/17] and [2/31, 3/30, 5/28, 6/27, 8/25, 9/24, 11/22, 12/21, 14/19, 15/18]

The former would go on the pentagonal faces (on the D12 or D32)

If we use Crockford's digits, this would be:

```
0     3     6     9     C     F
  1 2   4 5   7 8   A B   D E
Z     V     R     N     K     G
  X W   T S   Q P   M L   J H
```

[Thomson 18](https://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-index.xq?mode=solid&id=Thomson18) could also be worth a look, looks like an area-balanced
Tetrakis Cuboctahedron?

[Not sure how to area-balance this](https://kitwallace.co.uk/3d/solid-index.xq?mode=solid&id=TruncatedIcosahedron): Conway?
