# Markdown Feature Family Tree?

This is something I feel like the CommonMark guy could really write: which dialects / variants of Markdown can be traced back to what systems, like:

- the Email/Usenet/IRC lineage of a lot of the syntax
  - Emphasis
  - Links
  - Quotes
  - Title headings?
    - I feel like this one also goes back to READMEs
  - Angle-bracket links
  - List bullet characters / rules
- Other stuff from the Gruber draft:
  - I know the hashes come from Aaron Swarts'z ATX
  - The backticks from shell
  - Images, I believe, were actually in the original
  - HTML is technically "part of Markdown" so ya gotta credit that world
- Did whatever PHP BBS invent the `:smile:` syntax?
  - So like maybe this doesn't independently come from GHFM
- GHFM
  - Fenced code blocks
    - kind of a logical combination of backticks and Python's triple-quote multiline literal syntax
  - Language extension I think was them?
    - StackOverflow had that awkward HTML comment thing
  - Tables
- Jekyll
  - YAML Frontmatter
- Gollum
  - Wiki links from MediaWiki syntax
