# Appendices

Here are some scrapyards

- [The Linkdump!][linkdump] For various shit I find around the web that I want to save, for later, but really save, not just fake-save like Tabalanche where I'm either gonna reopen it within three days or I'm never going to want to look at it again
- [Cut Comments][], for little things I typed then didn't end up including in whatever I was working on.
- [new slang I'm trying on][dict]
- [ideas for songs][songs]
- [clearinghouse for describing things I can't just post video clips of due to copyright bs][unlinkable.md]
- [Loose Notes][], the final appendix
