# Weird Stubs

This is a fun little zone collecting all the pages that *maybe* have a purpose? Like, they have the seed of an idea that's unique, even if their *in practice* purpose has all leaked out.

This should maybe become a [Department of Barfspace]()

- [the former Toolchain Quests page](0031208d-0493-4dcf-9d70-6dbf1daaa52c.md)
- I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note that were tacked onto Operation Trapper Keeper and now live [here](2e874825-eb8d-4b42-9c31-dfcf4f30a799.md), those ought to move, maybe rejoin Unusual Studio Quests, maybe as a subpage (should USQ become an Unusual Studio Notes Hub, which can link out to the Unusual Studio Kind Of consultancy hub?)
