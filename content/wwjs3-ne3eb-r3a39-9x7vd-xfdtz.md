# hub for notes about Git!

how have I not already made a page for this! the [Notestack Core of Engineers](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) is constantly making notes that touch on Git

## Git-related research

- [Gitolite](cw5f4-gxafp-e0ayc-70sgf-8yj8x)

## projects for Git remotes

- [editor history Git remote](1dzb3-gbj93-ma8t8-p06mh-3j1mh)
- [Dat remotes](wwjs3-ne3eb-r3a39-9x7vd-xfdtz)

## a thought on Git just now

having a Git core for these notes is so critical, because, like, look at me inserting a note [here](t1zk1-jqgcq-wq9ag-dgkdj-p64y5), so long after making the page. it makes a lot more sense if you see the blame markers indicating that was just added
