# Maker Journeys

[Everybody Gets a Factory][EGAF] is a similar cluster around discovering various technologies around personal manufacturing, sort of like a second draft around the blunt block-of-marble notes I initally take here.

[Adventures in 3D Printing][3dp] is the general nexus for 3d-printing-related learning. Pages in the list below should be worked into that one (even if they're part of EGAF, probably, since the nature of that page is to be a more table-of-contents-y overview than EGAF's full narrative choose-your-own-adventure-y structure.)

- [Mesh cleanup](k6srm-b2var-0f9m8-qtw72-z8x8b)
