# The CRDS in a Literate World

So, I'm not going to make a literate copy of the CRD YAML files, which were essentially vendored in.

I'm thinking, in a case like this, I'd just leave the `.yaml` files be, and include a `.md` that could manually link them in, or even link to a rendered version of them with syntax-highlighting, line numbering, etc.

I think that's a reasonable expectation, that a repo will include `.yaml`, `.md`, and `.yaml.md`, and it should have rules for handling it.

## now, let's get crazy

What about `.fountain`? or `.fountain.md` (for Annotated Screenplays, which are awesome)?

this is where we start getting into the realm of "things I'd like to do with Eleventy"
