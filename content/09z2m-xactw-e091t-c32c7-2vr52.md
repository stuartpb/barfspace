# On Semi-Redundant Semantic Trees

(This is a meta-musing on a messy aspect of how I work these notes, which I think puts it in at least three jurisdictions. This is gonna be relevant in another context in a second.)

There's value in having a lot of pages linking out to other pages that are also linked to by similar pages - it forms a kind of semantic network / web - basically a big sticky substance in the "neural" structure of these notes.
