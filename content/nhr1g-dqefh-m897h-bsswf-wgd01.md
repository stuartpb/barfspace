# UEJI Vision Board / Outline

so it's like the beginning of Raiders of the Lost Ark meets Good Will Hunting, a guy from the Electrical Engineering department (Jason) walks into the ancient studies department and asks why they've got a boolean logic circuit pinned up against the wall. He explains to the spook representative that this diagram they found charts the progression of bits

I was going to say "this could be pre-1941 to make it less like Raiders" but actually, considering the premise, no

cut to Private Innput in his convoy, reading the source documents brought to him. He translates from the German, and notices a few things, a few parts that have names very different from what you'd call these procedures - you'd normally see encryption and decryption called "Verschlüsselung" and "Entschlüsselung", but instead these say "bestatten" and "berufen", which mean something more like "entomb" and "summon" - but, most noticeably, that the Germans seem to have not invented this, either. The documents are like they're spying on whoever's code this is, too - but whose?

He demonstrates the intracies of the "flacherpufferen", which translates to something like "flat pillows"? by illustrating with someone's little stuffed bunny from home that's the sort of squad mascot, Foo, and a nearby bar that's lying around, and illustrates how he can make the bar point at Foo, even if you move Foo. And he can make people in the squad say things? But there's still so many fields in the object that they don't understand

anyway, in the big climactic fight scene, he's initially reluctant to use his magic, saying it's not ready yet, but after seeing things go south soon
