# barfspace

nothing added to commit but untracked files present

## this repo intentionally left blank

This repo is based on me needing a place to put a few weeds that sprung up in my workspace for [meditations](https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations), where I totally forgot what the aesthetic of the files therein was supposed to be (which is why [I added a note about that shortly before spinning up this repo](https://github.com/stuartpb/meditations/commit/3d5eafe65e662ed2d5802ee8626e81d740699b47)).

The thing about those files is that, beyond the ones that had gone *somewhat* off-course but not to the extent that I hadn't felt comfortable comitting them, I'd basically started writing stream-of-consciousness blog posts, which I hate, because I never know how to finish, and it makes me look like a pompous ass, and I think I even called meditations "where I excrete my thinkpieces" at one point, and ugh that is not what that repo was supposed to be, and this is me fixing that. (I need to finish fixing `meditations`, though, to pull everything that should be *here* out of *there*.)

Honestly, this writing is *good and worth it* (which is why I don't just, you know... not write it), but, I don't know, I never feel comfortable pushing commits for it because they're never finished, or even finished forming a first cohesive point, nothing that'd be solid enough to commit.

Anyway, the reason it's called barfspace is because I intend the bulk of the content to be not in the repo itself, but in the C9 workspace where I continuously compose the files while likely never committing them, because they'll never be truly "ready to commit" (oh great, even my *files* have commitment issues).

The workspace is public, so here's where you can see this freakshow: https://ide.c9.io/stuartpb/barfspace

I need to sleep right now, maybe this'll turn into something, the way all crappy crap-fields become kingdoms (see: Linux, Git, Wikipedia, Python 2, Perl 5, the web) and all beautiful shrines become ashes and ghosts (see: MULTICS, HURD, Python 3, Perl 6, vaporware in general).

also maybe I should move this to Glitch

hmm actually that's an interesting point, maybe I'll just make an app that displays the working contents of md files in a Glitch project

anyway that should go in an issue or something, but yah hi this is the repo where everything is a terrible mess

ALSO I'd be remiss if I didn't explicitly shout out Jenn Schiffer here, who makes me feel completely OK with making work that's personal and important but gives zero shits about being polished beyond what I want to convey
