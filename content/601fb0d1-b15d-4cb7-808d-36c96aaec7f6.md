# I Should Have a Proper "Contacting" Page

So, what I mean is,

- I can be reached by email
  - if you're cool being on an "email" level of contact
  - where I won't see what you've sent me until I choose to open what's in my inbox
    - I don't have preview notifications for email messages, I find them intrusive and upsetting
    - this mirrors the nice UX of the browser
- I migrate away from Wire
  - the thing I explain in my contact page is that:
    - if I want to be in "DMs" with you
      - we can connect on whatever channel you want
        - signal, SMS, voicemail, stuff like that
          - I might even go for Briar at some experimental point
            - or SEcure Scuttlebutt, or other distributed dreams...
          - and of course I'm looking at PwnMAIL
          - but like also, I can connect on IRC or Discrod or (eugh) Slack
        - might also try
        - but that'll be similarly low-priority to email
          - though channels are distinguished in their natural ways, ie. DMs vs
          - the experimental stuff might get priority
        - and honestly, I'm not gonna keep a Discord open
          - among other things, they're cop-friendly
          - same goes for Slack re: sucking
          - blasphemers to Eris' name, the lot of 'em

- what I want in terms of Stubernetes
  - (this should be its own page / the page)
  - I'm thinking I'll host a Riot.im / Matrix server
  - I'd also like to set up a Hubs server for making calls
    - and probably also other simpler WebRTC things
      - Jitsi?
      - What happend to that \&yet one? IS that still around?
      - What are their maximum occupancies?
  - I might host our own internal email for stuartandtiare.com
    - like the clintons lol
    - outbound would still go through FastMail because reputation

## A thought here that came out of considering a Purpose-Built Worker

## BLIP Thought for Oozy Sewer

I wonder if it's working with Kubernetes specs that's making my notes so naturally take a bulleted-list-tree form like this

this also overlaps with Markdown as Schema and that whole cluster, huh
