# Petlogs: the fleeting lives of mutable systems

See the [About Petlogs](f66caf27-1b92-43ad-89f1-cb796fd15dc7.md) page for some background and philosophy behind these pages (some of which is out of date, as it refers to the directory structure that originally spawned the layout of these pages).

For more on how these logs are going to be restructured amd integrated going forwward, see [Camp Papalima](4f705b65-cc3c-4f66-a256-ae5e5777d276.md).

## My Devices

### The Two Installations of My Desktop

I dual-boot (usually in Linux these days):

- [stushiba](60b5d7c5-b966-4349-9ed8-92c4a4b74422.md) (Arch Linux)
- [stutendo](70fac3cc-17b3-408a-82f4-9e0253c5cecb.md) (Windows 10)

### Laptops

- [stuzzy](8668a51b-83e9-465c-953d-f8de57201c8b.md) (Arch Linux on an x64 Chromebook)
- [stukilla](62907e4e-f535-4676-9863-91c1e3b2eb2d.md) (Arch Linux on an ARMv7 Chromebook)

### Phones

- [stuixel](2c42d49f-88a0-4af5-9b2b-f209eec08a92.md) (Google Pixel 2 XL running Magisk-rooted Android)

### Portable installations

- [sturling](70988968-e980-4d15-93ce-1a2eeb67e77c.md) (Arch Linux on a 32GB flash drive)
- [stuquart](eaac9d0b-dc62-4b54-9983-feb76c54da5b.md) (Windows 10 on a 500GB hard drive in a USB3 enclosure)

### "Embedded" devices

- [sturaspi](425e5cda-e1ef-4d01-a346-5c2b072e767e.md) (Raspbian on a Raspberry Pi)
- Even embeddier: stuflair (a FlashAir I don't think I've written logs for yet)
- [ESP8266/ESP32 stuff](be8ef21f-ea6e-4f96-8b87-9a54694fb29f.md) is generally documented in use journals for one of these systems bootstrapping it

### Cloud Virtual Servers

- [stuvern](0aba9622-f21e-4b9e-949d-62265141e0c3.md) (Arch Linux on DigitalOcean)

I'm pretty sure I moved stuvern as a name to Vultr, actually?

## Shared issues

The [Papercuts and Annoyances](d07f30ca-f065-4fb7-9541-b09b656313c5.md) page documents shared issues across machines (or at least, it's supposed to).
