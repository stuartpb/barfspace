Running `sudo pacman -Syu`, then installing f2fs-tools.

Before I take this flash disk (the original storage for stuzzy) out of the drive bay it's been sitting in, I want to clobber the data that was previously on it by repurposing the drive to some other ends.

I install `f2fs-tools` and `hdparm`...

I'd like to completely reset this drive, so I look at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_state_drive/Memory_cell_clearing, and it's got some interesting suggestions, but it notes that the drive shouldn't be wiped over USB, so I'll try messing with the drive later (after using `hdparm` to check that I *can* do this), probably on stushiba.
