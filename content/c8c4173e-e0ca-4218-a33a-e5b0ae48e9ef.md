# All the Lean Notes on Software

See the [Lean Notes root page](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md) for more about what all this was (and could become).

(note: I've trashed the fluff that used to live here, if you think it was so great than go back in the Git history and fish it out, you're gonna be disappointed)

Awkward, huh? That's why most of this is meant to be read in the form of pages linking to each other in little "you might be interested in this also" connections - just dumping everything I know into one giant, linear mess isn't particularly easy to orient by interest.

Honestly, the main thing unifying all these right now - because they're not even really all that consistent about their domain - is that they're all incomplete on Trello. As they get migrated out from Trello, they're probably going to start finding their way to more intelligent slices, which this page can link to instead of even presenting this gross collection of non-spaces.
