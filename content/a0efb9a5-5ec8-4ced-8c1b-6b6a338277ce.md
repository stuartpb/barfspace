# Notes from learning Rust and WebAssembly and stuff

Went ahead and installed `rustup` so I could build Xi on Stushiba, so, hey, might go and try learning Rust. Might do that as part of my general looking-into of WebAssembly.

https://github.com/mbasso/awesome-wasm saves me a ton of time here

## WASI stuff

This was a thing I was thinking around the Windowsystem Metabrowser, the "engine" processes could work like this, idk

https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/master/docs/WASI-documents.md

https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime/blob/master/docs/WASI-api.md is a good explainer on the API itself

https://github.com/CraneStation/wasmtime is cool but I remember documenting something about the kernel implementation - is this buried in my old Quadration quest notes?

it links to https://wasi.dev/polyfill/ as a polyfill but the project infrastructure around it looks p weak

## out-of-browser wasm

https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer seems best

## odd thought

I wonder if it's possible to compile these wasm engines to [RISC-v][] - I mean, I'd think so, because that's a Rust target

but that'd mean you'd have intentional, safe code, runnable in a trusted kernelspace, on a well-designed open architecture, which'd be sweet
