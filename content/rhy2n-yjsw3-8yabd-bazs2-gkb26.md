# Federation / Decentralization Anarchy Headquarters

This is meant to be a more concrete spinoff of [Smuggler's Cove](b39ge-ag6e2-y39vc-qwm8a-cmwmy) (which can now focus on more philosophical topics)

This is all about decentralized and federated web(like) tech.

## Studying up

here are some [Journals](jg1g6-ex272-0h8cp-te3en-0y9cq) studying tech for this:

- Decentralization/P2P protocols
  - [IPFS](4g3s4-t7yp4-yx97b-ptzwy-tj1he)
  - [Dat](8ddf3-z8x3g-ppab4-dzm4g-m3g2h)
  - [BitTorrent](fhpaj-h3r2g-67a3e-jx6jy-0prf7)
  - [IPFS vs Dat vs BitTorrent](rs2cr-fe54h-mk9c6-hszd3-rz6jp), as I see it
  - Identity Hiding
    - [Tor](qxj1f-9rcjy-cwa3f-pnraj-jqz7t)
    - [Noise Protocol](8ajqc-x7137-jpagp-anj0d-pp3we)
- Federation Protocols
  - [Social Web Protocols](khjv5-3rj5m-m3a6h-n5zay-k3nxd)
  - [Solid](mj9xe-zafae-m791f-pptpx-affgj)

Also:

- [Git](wwjs3-ne3eb-r3a39-9x7vd-xfdtz)

## State of the Future

There are a few movements going on right now:

- the Indie Web, which focuses on Microformats to share between individually-owned-and-operated platforms
- the Fediverse, which focuses on ActivityPub to share across many collectively-operated communities
- the Decentralized Web, which focuses on rethinking the "operation"

The first two are captured by the Social Web Protocols, and the last one by Solid.

- [Portable Identity](cjjjj-8ccj8-6va1s-8p856-cjv8r)
  - will probably lead out to a larger "matters of identity" hub at some point
  - this can be extra important

## some thoughts

You could have ActivityPub streams served over Dat

does Dat support killing old blocks? I imagine probably not, I think hash integrity would be compromised?

## Projects

Here I could list a bunch of my projects and what part of the centralized world they replace, or how they serve federation

- [this page on the original intention of Lean Notes back when it was Glass Tubes](0d8cc-k29em-qw93j-mj01y-dkf5a)
  - lays out what could be a compelling killer app for the Fediverse
  - this is starting to evolve into a real KubeApps running box
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline](mhmrc-a1fqb-8m9yc-bjq3m-ph145) is definitely ActivityPub-friendly
- [Honeydew Browser](qfxxj-99818-mkar6-2xdfx-tt10c)
