# App Ideas for Project Parking

- the ParkedProject.con Service
- [thoughts specifically around the DNS-oriented aspect of Parked Project](416491ee-4b52-4887-96f0-465f361a36ea.md)
- I'm also thinking of this in terms of [Ops in a Box](035d1e22-7dca-4901-aa4a-1624e7a6a15c.md), where you want this to pre-configure as being instance-wide for one project, and the user is definitely registered from an outside authority
