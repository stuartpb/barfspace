# whoa wtf

video was glitched (all windows compositing garbage data) when coming back to the system this morning (after all the Rainpower logging-out-and-in last night). Tried a `sudo pacman -Syu` from tty3 and rebooted, we'll see if that fixes it. (Is this a bug that only manifests after logging out and in a few times?)
