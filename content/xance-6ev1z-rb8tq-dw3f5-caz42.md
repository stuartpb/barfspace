# Archaeology Force

This is the counterpart to the Academy's [Notegraph Historium](rjnhy-tyar8-05aw9-svgbr-akn86), under the juristiction of [the Department](mfrzq-ch8r8-wj9a3-bdbdx-ffkc4),that originally gathered at [how-i-roll's Tomb](qfntb-snnda-gx9ah-w284r-hwz8j)

Its job is to find historic notes and move them into pages under the Historium

It produced an onboarding unit with Operation Trapper Keeper for integrating my old OneNote notes: the [Deep Note Divers](nkn3z-e2b1m-weaxz-9teq7-d9w42)

There's also the [planfile historical content expedition](na999-h6tqn-gra5p-tvqtv-26vwe) to produce pages for content that was removed from stuartpb.plan

[Trello Crew](p0mx5-yd911-w2apy-747v8-7wtcp) is another division
