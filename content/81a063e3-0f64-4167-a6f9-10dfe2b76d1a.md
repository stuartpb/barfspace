# The Stuworks Journal

Stuworks is an assembly of machines working in unison to form a 3D printer:

- stuflair, the flashair
- the [as-yet-unnamed octopi installation](5bbc6d64-b33e-4eb4-8280-48509cbcc404.md)
- the Prusa i3 MK3S itself
- the MMU2S unit and all the sprawl that entails

## Plans and "State of the Printer"

Notable "upgrades" in place:

- Official Prusa upgrades:
  - MK3 -> MK3S
  - MMU2S (with some later MK3S parts used from this kit as of [2020-02-07](b0c635e8-e94f-4ef8-8cd4-7163365483c6.md))
  - Raspberry Pi
- Alternate parts:
  - M10 fitting mod
  - Drybox upgrade for filament #5
- Vitamin tweaks:
  - Nylock mod
  - Nylock in idler door
- Control mods:
  - Dimmer circuit added to LCD backlight.
  - Custom faceplate with arm with cutout for adjustment trimpot on standard RepRapDiscount controllers, as well as a slot for the Brightness adjuster (which should really just be replaced with a switch, I think I wrote that somewhere)
- New parts:
  - Tooling fan grate
  - Visualizers
  - Nozzle holder
  - Silicone sock (sometimes)
