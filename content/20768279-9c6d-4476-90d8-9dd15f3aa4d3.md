# Windowsystem Metabrowser

This is an idea that I have sometimes: that it'd be cool to have a windowsystem where the browser and its apps (and "native apps") can coexist, almost like how Android briefly put Chrome tabs in with native apps

anyway the idea with this is that you'd have nesting levels and tabbing interface selections / constructions enough that the role of a "browser window" can be handled by just a nesting tab (where the top-level "tabs" could be managed like GNOME's interface, or Windows or Android or Mac OS or Chrome OS's repackaging of whatever crap)

I was just using [Code (OSS)](73ce0d7f-758e-40ef-ae0a-c37e4a5bf2cd.md) and thinking "it'd be cool if I could dock a couple Firefox tabs next to my terminal", and that got me thinking, it'd be cool if Code's sidebars could live alongside Firefox's somehow. Anyway, food for thought.
