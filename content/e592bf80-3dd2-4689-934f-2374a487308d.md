# More Space for Studtop

I'm worried I'm gonna run out of space on studtop:

```
Filesystem                                              1K-blocks     Used  Available Use% Mounted on
/dev/mmcblk0p2                                           15112012 12537952    1790756  88% /
```

I'm also worried about RAM, [but there's nothing I can do about that](3f468977-84d8-45f5-9381-408fc7c6adab.md)

After much bouncing around, I've concluded that the root for pod images (which I'd expect to take up the bulk of this "state", if all the other big data is in PersistentVolumes) is under `/var/lib/rancher/k3s/agent/containerd/`, so that's the directory I'm gonna mount on a 64GB USB 3.0 flash drive I just bought.
