# Machine code, assembly, and old-days hardware access

So, you can think of machine code like what you'd punch on a punch card, and assembly like what you'd write down to punch

machine code being the gate configurations that lead to the logic you want

a compiler is a program that takes something written the way you'd write it and turns it into machine code
