# stuartpb Planfile Historical Content Expedition

an [Operation Trapper Keeper](3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca) task force

can also be thought of as an [Archaeology Force](xance-6ev1z-rb8tq-dw3f5-caz42) expedition for the history of what became [The Right Now Outpost](vqf81-6650g-8ka3r-k582q-b2vnh)

See also [the planfile postmortem](ydct3-s9y9z-8g8qr-rd0rt-wezm4), which should be filled out while conducting this expedition

## detritus from earlier incarnations of this page

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

There ought to be a page specifically on the role of Right Now going forward (wow, that is a meta-sounding sentence)

UPDATE: I think this'd be the Planfile Postmortem - which needs to remember that I still need to go back and retrieve dead items that amy be of interest *from the Git history*, since there was a point where I was like "I'll delete anything I'm not working on, and the only way to find it will be by searching history, that'll make things easier than keeping a hierarchy".

Reminder that there's a note on Project Akira about reviving Right Now, pull from that when splitting this off to its own page (which I tried to do but Gitpod started acting up)

should probably get consolidated into / around [this page reflecting on the old planfile](ydct3-s9y9z-8g8qr-rd0rt-wezm4)
