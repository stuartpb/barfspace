# My Life in Quests

This is a kind of legacy page, tracking a few lingering Quests pages that haven't been worked into the structure of these notes, which all have their roots in a great giant page I made for Quests back in the early days of this repo (might have even been before Project Akira, I'd have to go back and check).

These days, I'm changing a lot of these pages into subject hubs that aren't quest-oriented.

For documentation of the old Quest content, see [the Quests Style Guide page](13ff3791-e256-443b-9b76-6ce1a594c7a8.md).

Note that I'm *really* moving toward just obsoleting this page and letting to-do lists emerge organically right now - I'm just straight-up deleting the pages that have been woven into the notes from here now, especially the stuff worked into the new Projects tree

## Still kinda relevant maybe

- [Mindfulness Arc](2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md) oughta get worked into somewhere where I'll think about it

## Largely unvisited since Quests was made

These are unloved and, if you asked me what's in 'em, I probably couldn't tell you.
