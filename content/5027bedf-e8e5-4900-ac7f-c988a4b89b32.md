# Possible household-dns implementation

This was the possibility I saw for Stubernetes and went "nah" thinking I'd use k8s_external instead

https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns/blob/master/docs/tutorials/coredns.md

another similar tutorial that references that one for KubeFed (in alpha): https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kubefed/blob/master/docs/ingress-service-dns-with-coredns.md

## on etcd

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-upgrade-etcd/

https://hub.helm.sh/charts/incubator/etcd or https://hub.helm.sh/charts/bitnami/etcd seem less elaborate, and less deprecated

## probably gonna go with this serving a .internal zone

I was also thinking about using the old technique to connect directly to hosts that'd otherwise be hosted externally by having them be CNAMEs to LoadBalancer, which this wouldn't support...

Eh... that might be something External-DNS can handle, whether to prefer the DNS entry suggested by LoadBalancer or Ingress (maybe with the help of some labels/annotations)?

## anyway, implementation

I'm thinking this'll be a Chart at `pluskube/ingress-dns` that deploys a Service that makes however many Replicas of a Pod with containers for `etcd`, `external-dns`, and `coredns`. The function of the chart is the core thing: the images inside it, like, having to spawn a throwaway `etcd` as a communication channel for a service that's just pulling its data from a control plane that's already probably `etcd`, that's not great - but they can be swapped out for any cleaner implementation that provides the same functionality.
