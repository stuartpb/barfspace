# the dystopian nature of capitalist celebrity

The point of normalizing celebrity through reality television is to make everyone as self-conscious about their image as people who are under constant surveillance

ie. people don't just ideate the celebrity glamour, they also self-inflict the obsession with being camera-appropriate

it's a self-imposed panopticon
