# The Honest Use of Namespaces in Bagtent

Actual directory levels may be warranted for Bagtent:

- when you've got some kind of submodule structure
  - or multi-user federation!
- when you've got a special set of tools you only want to run on certain files
  - and riflng through all the files' metadata would just be a hassle
- literate routes

overlaps with all the other Bagtent stuff, also the glob of rambling Module Tree stuff that's been coming out lately
