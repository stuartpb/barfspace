# The Loneliness Survival Handbook

Basically, I saw that "How to Be Alone" book, and I feel like I need to make a book out there that says "it's okay to not want to be alone, and the trick is not letting it eat you alive while you try to connect with someone, anyone"

I don't know. The point is to, like, help people understand the boundary between "healthy" and "desperate", and that it's going to feel like getting punched in the gut repeatedly, *and that's not your fault* (and how to diagnose the distinct possibility that it *might* be, so that you don't have to have anxiety that you're just powering through being an asshole and thinking everyone else is the problem).
