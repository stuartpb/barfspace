# Touchscreen-and-Keyboard Windowsystem Concept

I feel like I've seen this, maybe on Android? Is it possible to intercept all dragging done on the touchscreen (so an outside pointer like the ThinkPad nubbin would still be OK to drag) so that up-and-down scrolls, and left-and-right switches windows?

It's mostly for when you just want a bunch of terminals open, but, like, you could also use it to switch into PICO-8

Anyway, this could be nice on the PocketC.H.I.P. (which is why I'm most thinking about Awesome)

Is this maybe doable if a key/button is held down

Oh yeah, what if you press the home button and it's like swiping up on Android, or however the home button works now? Or I guess it's like the iOS app switcher? And I know I've seen some tab switchers - anyway, it zooms out

But yeah, on the Pi screen, there's no button, so I'd really just like some way to say "all touch is meant as a super-gesture"

Maybe tapping the screen works like the home button, in that it zooms out? idk this is starting to feel like just "hit the key" stuff

awesome doesn't let you recomposite windows, does it? Is there anything comparable? Deno?
