# The "Worse is Better" Collection

Here are some [messays](hwhnk-bgrdy-4rbbs-9kyf0-qfsrw) on a theme of "don't overplan things, don't sweat the small stuff, crap conquers all" generally known as "Worse is Better" (aka The Jersey Core)

- [My Old Bad Ideas](yfsxd-ek388-ct9ye-xb9we-qb9mj)
- [Humans Don't Need (Much) Structure](vbm7b-rxw4t-mc9jr-w9nrg-kfz8e) (My New Good Ideas)

- [Relying On and Reproducing Context](hhbyk-ta02s-459vh-tc237-ppp4m) (*very* sloppy, this one's pretty out-there)
- [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity](7vrfz-hc1hv-1pbx4-0ahfb-eq1wr), about the terrifying cognitive loop of trying to get too meta

A few more very rough reflections on the nature of [barfspace][OBRN] that used to live on the [meta page][BSMC]:

## Sort of related

- [On Bad Defaults](g6hxw-14rnq-c5a5j-n4h4f-fnfpj) talks about how relying on the defaults is a kind of "worse is better" for the user

## On Worse is Better in the Abstract Structure of the Notes

Meta reflections on barfspace in general live in [The Academy](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j), and other kinds of meta document about these notes can be found from there.

For notes that could live either here or there, there's [this joint Academy page](6yanh-hg3gd-s69sp-wyba4-qgkgt) about the placement of... I think itself? It's sort of meant as a bridge between these two classes of note, and reflecting on the nature of such bridges

(per the note I just added on that page, said junction should be listed higher here, so ideas with that context in mind can find that gathering point more easily)
