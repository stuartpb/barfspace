# Weird Stubs

This is a fun little zone collecting all the pages that *maybe* have a purpose? Like, they have the seed of an idea that's unique, even if their *in practice* purpose has all leaked out.

This should maybe become a [Department of Barfspace]()

This could also be treated as "these pages aren't orphans, but they might as well be, for how far out in the sticks they are relative to where they should be"

- [the former Toolchain Quests page](0031208d-0493-4dcf-9d70-6dbf1daaa52c.md)

- [this page](a7dde721-d7cb-437a-8497-f0c0f011756a.md) under The Unconvincing Truth lists a plan to reintegrate it, but I'm not sure where that place would be
