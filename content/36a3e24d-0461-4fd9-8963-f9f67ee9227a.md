sometimes I listen to music

## now playing 2019-05-20

I've been listening to Isaac Ascii on Bandcamp: most of these albums are generic slowed-down-80s-pop trash, but I kind of like [past the places where the steal beam meet concrete skies](https://isaacascii.bandcamp.com/album/past-the-places-where-the-steal-beam-meet-concrete-skies), which is lazily titled enough to really resonate here
