# You Are What Your Content Looks Like

Did you know that SGML had self-closing tag syntax? It was written like `<br/` - yes, without the closing `>`.

All HTML parsers were supposed to support this.

None of them did. (cf [this old documentation from Node's HTML5 package](https://github.com/aredridel/html5/blob/master/doc/api.markdown#space_before_trailing_solidus))

Because everybody writing parsers was just trying to make something that would work for what other people were writing, and  everybody was just copying each other.

And *nobody would have thought that was the syntax by looking at everything else in HTML*.

Remember that people catch your rules by *watching how others are written*, not by reading your spec. If your definition isn't intuitive, it won't just be a stumbling block - it will straight up *erode to the intuitive behavior* unless you can *clearly state why it shouldn't*, and *build a test case illustrating your point*.

And, of course, if you just weren't thinking about it too hard, then, well... users and implementors will work together to fix your mistakes for you without even realizing they're doing it

(I feel like a lot of GNU extensions over POSIX are like this)
