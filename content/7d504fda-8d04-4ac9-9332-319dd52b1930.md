# on petlogs and news

the petlogs woud work better if they were merged into this repo

They'd work better because they all just generally work like [News][], complete with being potentially applicable in different contexts and needing to link out to other junctions

[News]: afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md

I'll probably do this on stushiba
