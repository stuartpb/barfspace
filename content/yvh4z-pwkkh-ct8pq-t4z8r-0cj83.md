# Example BISNES model

I haven't committed to metadata blocks for this repo yet, so don't expect any here.

But you can imagine it'd look something like this:

```yaml
bisnes:
  model:
  - key: name
    description: Subject's name
  - key: aliases
    type: string[]
    description: Other names the subject is known by
```
