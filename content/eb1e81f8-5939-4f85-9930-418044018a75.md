# Barfspace Office of Construction Plans

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way.

It'll also probably turn into a nexus for the codification of processes that get followed in these notes somewhat? IDK, that might be implying more cohesion to this editing than can ever really be hoped for

This is for sussing out the structure of a plan itself. For following its implementation (so far as anything needs to be done point-by-point, instead of in one big commit), see [Barfspace Operations][BOPS].
