# Identity Implementation Notes Hub

The real base for identity in the future web is the Web Authentication spec - I'll make notes for that in a bit

## Older notes

- Email addresses and WebFinger
- Any old web page via [IndieAuth](https://indieauth.com/)
  - though it sounds like they really want page routes?
  - This would be a *fantastic* standard for domain registrars to get in on
- WebID (part of the Solid spec)

Should also conceptualize this as *interchangeable* identity, ie. where a person may have several personas / hats they identify under for the context of a post or data or whatever:

- brands
- organizations / teams
- other plural structures
- personal / professional / social identities
- 18+ / locked accounts
