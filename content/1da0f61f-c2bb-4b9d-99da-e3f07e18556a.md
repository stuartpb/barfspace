# How I am Currently Trying to Sort My Shit Out

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the current nexus for my base of operations under the [Department of Development][DoD]. Update your bookmarks.

Right now, I just did a bunch of the "reconciling Lean Notes with the rest of the repo" work I'd been wanting to do, moving links around.

I kind of want to get back to the whole Lean Notes project proper, now that it lives here.

Past that, I want to sort out what the hell is going on with my "Right Now" and "Projects" indices: like, I feel like those could probably get woven together better.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note.

I want to explain that Google Keep is a huge supplement to this repo, somewhere. I think there's a note about me needing to explain my note-taking process somewhere around here - I'll probably work on that, at some point.
