# Make-Your-Own Flat (Or Even Ribbon) Cabling

This is an extension of the overall No-Soldering Wire Construction

I'm thinking of this in the context of developing something akin to a 3D Printable Micro SD Extension Cable

So you'd make it so you'd measure out whatever parallel bus you need in strands of equally-cut lengths of wire (the same kind that's used to wire up a Solderless Card, though you might want to also consider, like, stainless steel thread, for flexibility?),

Then you'd stretch them taut like guitar strings, thne you'd pour silicone (or some epoxy/resin) over them to insulate from each other and outside

## other prospects

- TPU?
  - I feel like you kind of can't make TPU cable that's low-profile enough for stuff like this or a Raspberri Pi (Zero) cable (like the display or camera bus)
- Woven cable braid
  - While I still think this is probably the way to go for ducting
    - (unless my other searches prove more fruitful),
  - I wouldn't trust it as the *actual jacketing* for anything?
    - Do even commerical braided cables do that?
      - Don't they have at least some level of shielding?
        - If you've got
