# bagtent

This is an index page for pages that talk about bagtent, ie. the tooling and structure of these notes

Most of these are carried out by the [Notestack Engineering Core](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md), who also handle non-bagtent related projects for my notes (like the Git commit shotclock).

## historical remark

this ought to be incorporated into whatever history of bagtent/barfspace+LN/notes.stuartpb.com is drafted: https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/issues/3 was where I originally came up with the architecture

also, I think there might be an artifact about [Lean Notes][]' original README? I might have gone ahead and broken that down though. The one that described the repo's layout? I think all the content from the old Lean Notes readme has been dispersed one way or another

## Related

[The Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md) collects documents about the structuring of these notes, which is heavily informed by bagtent.

[Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) collects reflections on organic tendencies that play around the design of bagtent

The organic junction that is [The Oozy Sewer](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) lies somewhere between those two and this page - probably more between this one and the Academy (hence why this page will probably become the University of Bagtent and this page can maybe get a catchier name - maybe "The Institute of Notanicus", that sounds suitably insane for these notes)

## Related Tools

Lots of the Notestack Engineering stuff is relevant to bagtent, but [git-shotclock and its interface for loose integration with bagtent-orphans](df25aada-7f8c-420c-97bc-51366556b6be.md) is close enough that I feel it's appropriate to link here.

## Notes

These first-level lists should probably all become pages, and this just becomes a high-level index page that links to all the above pages, and all the below first-level-heading-cum-pages

- [the original bagtent braindump](9432d8de-485e-4253-8dcb-e8ed3dda45f9.md) which I've tried to split out (only one original digression still lives there now) into a series of sub-notes per overall cohesive "thought" (which have been moved into lists below).
- [Bagtent Tool Notes](e1c84681-d395-4533-81c1-233f5bb5bbe3.md) (ie. scripts)
- other braindump stuff (pardon the awkward break, these are kind of separate trees)
  - These might move back into the original braindump node, which then has a focus on "spec stuff"?
- [Web navigation interface thoughts](bf03649f-7721-4d95-af2e-bfe803bf996a.md)
- Federation topics (this stuff should maybe get split off to be closer to the Scope Oracle / Visions):
  - [Bagtent Intelligence Gathering stuff][BISNES/BIGDOG]
  - [A Democratic Model for Federating Content](f8b2045d-b8e0-4e27-a565-43abb45b8e87.md)
  - [Federating Barfspace](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md) (mostly predates bagtent)
- [Live Collaboration on Bagtent](348066c6-9133-4e2b-92e1-d75ebd126849.md)
  - Also talks about distributing write access via Dat
- [Random UUIDs as a concept / UUID Usability Nexus](25d7f993-c280-4075-87cb-535c51102b26.md)
