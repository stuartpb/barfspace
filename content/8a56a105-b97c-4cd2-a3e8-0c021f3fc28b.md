Extension plans:

- Passing the parameters to the callback as a third argument, allowing for tricks like `end:0` to be set.
- A mutable state to pass to the callback as a fourth argument, that will be used as the return value for the function.
  - This will also allow the callback to be optional, defaulting to a function that collects pairs as a two-dimensional array, ie. for use passing to `new Map`.

## Thoughts on params.short

I'm glad I didn't make this a default like I'd been planning.

Short opts are really a special-case of parsing, and you might as well have special support for them in valid positions anyway.
