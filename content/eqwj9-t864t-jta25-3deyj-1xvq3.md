# magickshop image editor

https://unusual.studio/projects/#6c60d00e-2db8-418b-95a7-969885c22923

So, the idea is, you upload an image, then you use dropdowns / a toolbox to make edits to the image (scale, crop, color balance, etc)

the browser previews all these operations on a canvas, then gives you the ImageMagick command line to re-apply them to any image

It can also save these command lines as "saved processes"

You could maybe even have, like, TensorFlow cleanup steps?

I think this is where this idea started to expand into the [Abstract Pipeline Runner](amyvx-h7853-878ea-s47wv-a18p1)

Anyway, this could still be prototyped as a future "component" of that "superproject"

## side note

Hey, I'm realizing this probably never got farther than a readme/notes: is it in the June Judgment?

oh, did I never actually make a repo for it? looking at the Unusual Studio project doc now, it doesn't seem to link one
