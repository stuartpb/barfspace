# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose "grand projects" that will or will not blend together over time:

- Lean Notes (not yet integrated)
- [barfspace][] (not yet disintegrated)
- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air][FBBA], a Discordian rite within the larger Chaos

## Also

[my-old-bad-ideas.md][], which has a lineage dating back to when these files actually had *names*, is currently home base for a plan I'm developing to unify all my previous projects into this one (having already merged a bunch of them into Lean Notes, which is not yet merged).
