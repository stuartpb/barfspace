[Professional Helmbags](nr7pj-tep5e-czbvn-82hch-0b8mn) for developers.

see also [System Administration Helmbags](3x3ew-aknad-rw94y-dnsms-s1ebp)

## Development suite

- GitLab
- GitPod or some other integrable Theia provisioner
- a [local/internal registry](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/)
- Any other supplemental CI
  - these [Helm deployment systems](https://kubedex.com/helm-deployments/) might apply
  - Maybe some kind of app that automatically sets up your GitLab configuration to push a buildpack and all the end-to-end stuff?

overlap with Wayside et al

Also overlaps with whatever Helmbag ends up suggesting JupyterHub (also, what about Coral?)
