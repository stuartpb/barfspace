# Anything New, Exciting, or Different

This is a page pointing to pages for stuff that's on the forefront of my mind, sort of like an "open tabs". (The fact that GitPod doesn't actually sync open tabs may have led into the drive to create this.)

On that subject, the first page I want to link in here is [my notes on GitPod](5018398f-fa13-45a5-98ac-d640fe4d5a41.md), because its limitations are at the forefront of my mind (and it's why I'm suddenly feeling an urge to commit pages like this that'll let me resume them in another environment).

Oh geez, I have 5 hours left this month, and this sucker is creaking, time to commit and push

even if I weren't about to lose gitpod access, having too many file tabs makes the editor take a while to open

## Speaking of cloud IDEs categorically

Also, nuts, I've only got two weeks until Cloud9 stops letting me access workspaces, shiiiiit - I need to find another solution, quick

Tracking this as [Closing Time](b7c6ef38-0130-439b-aad1-40eb31ada49c.md)

the way I'm handling it right now is to use [Code (OSS)](73ce0d7f-758e-40ef-ae0a-c37e4a5bf2cd.md) on a local machine, which isn't great, but it's not the worst - I'm going to look into a minikube-based solution in a bit

## applying to jobs

but I don't really like talking about it right now

writing cover letters

## Pearls of Discord

The other big thing I'm working on when I'm not writing these notes is [this necklace](6dc617ce-7fc0-4c57-937e-2656af78f664.md). I'm specifically experimenting with [printing the beads](369c67c5-e608-4dcd-9f61-0cb357e6350e.md) right now.

If that page doesn't link to the ESP8266 page, it should, and this one should too because I'm dealing with it/NodeMCU a lot

## OctoPrint

In the process, I'm also getting back into [using OctoPrint](5bbc6d64-b33e-4eb4-8280-48509cbcc404.md)

There's some [3D Printer upgrade work](0b49c0ed-b327-4005-879e-59762d3af2b5.md) that went into this that I haven't uploaded - there's other stushiba stuff that I don't think is on GitHub at the moment to address there at some point, too.

## Firefox

Another big thing with me lately is that I'm [moving to Firefox](7b0f829a-7fbe-4896-9b5d-8196e1bca2a4.md).

In the process, I'm finding myself needing to revisit [Tabalanche](1bba5664-3cd1-4f22-903b-fd35c6844ac0.md)'s codebase for porting, and NilPass as well (the UI is bigger due to not having the font size reset, not sure if I documented this in Tabalanche or NilPass in issues).

I'm familiarizing myself with [WebExtensions](34349df2-97b4-4095-8df4-d37056211e46.md)

## Right Now for in These Notes

(I don't know that there's a distinct page for this yet - I think it's more of a "Department/Academy of Barfspace catalogs snapshots from this section, or a page like it, on a regular basis" thing)

I just accidentally conjured a new page, so, [right now for the notes here](9d2999b6-8d6d-417b-9a60-36df93a05192.md)

note that should get updated like I meant to do that, to categorize the refactors that are happening in the notes in a way suitable to form an institution

as that ended up turning into a big mass that I may have not given its own page - or as that page ended up going too much into one subject to fill a broader duty of encapsulating all that's going on in these notes (a form of mutation in creation that happens sometimes) - I'm going to summarize here (another form of note mutation that would get explored on the following page) that [this page about specific observed phenomena in the notes](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) is *hella trending for me right now, yo*

I'm even considering giving it a proper name, all institution-like!

That's been a trend going on lately, lots of reshuffles around the Department of Barfspace (which might get renamed), lots of new task forces and subgroups being formed to handle different duties, lots of old pages of stuff like Quests or notes on a thing in these notes getting reframed as standing forces to collect and implement that thing, lots of new jurisdictions springing up

Weird Stubs being another prospective institution (maybe that should become a subsection of the org chart page? Or the content of the org chart, to be an incubator, and the established players live on the root?)

Mutation Notegrowth thought: This is a not-that-bad way to create a hierarchy: more-traveled pages live one page up. You can Graduate like that. But then there's the matter of, do you allow notes to fall back, how do you adapt out decreases in traffic, explore this.

the [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) getting split out to track tech/vertical implementation work is one of the more prominent changes, though the [Academy of Barfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), as parent to the previously-mentioned introscpection, is coming along

[bagtent's root note](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) is finally getting some respect, too

I imported Petlogs, been using those a bit

History is shaping up a bit

Did I already write the thing about blueprints at notes for improvements to the notes, that can be used as the next iteration of the notes once their links have beeen filled out? that should get merged into the "right now for the notes here" page I made above either way, I'm tired, I need to cut this commit and sleep

## Project Hoard 2K19

Another thing that's starting to ramp up is the prospect of tying notes to my bins - I'm thinking I'll print out Data Matrix codes...

I almost said "for these notes' UUIDs", because that'd let the labels be like hyperlinks...

Actually... I might include that as a feature in the whiteboard iteration as a use for the removable yellow label paper!

Still needs recognition -> link support.

I don't know if I've written this down, but I'm thinking the UUIDs will work just like the QR codes were going to, but without as much of an emphasis on recognizing other stuff on the bin

but so yeah, then what you'd do is you'd keep these UUIDs in notes, and you'd include the UUID in your note as a sentinel that it refers to the contents of that bin - maybe a special form like a line matching "^Tag: (UUID goes here)$" to get priority (others would be treated like hyperlinks to a page that exists in meatspace and not bagspace, searchable only to find what parents and theme indices are referencing you - not that I honestly expect to copy an asset tag's UUID to pages not expressly for it)

contents can be described in boxes

but so yeah that's a thing, the white DataMatrix labels (which I'm thinking might be printed "bigwise" and placed on the entire sidebar) would be permanent (so they'd stick on the side edge), so they'd want to refer ro a "separate asset" (so the "taggedness" relation to this label can jump nodes like any other content, in case other pages link to that page for a purpose irrelevant to its original function)

Note that that semantic shift of entities is a key component to the CBGBism messay, it should be linked in

this is the REAL heir to the intended use of boxesin, fwiw - the borkflowy "accordion interface" is pretty much just what the other half'd be

## A thing I was thinking it'd be appropriate to write about

I had a thing happen recently that I ought to write a page for, about what to do when "feeling cute" becomes "might delete later" long enough to enter Google search history

if I don't get around to it, you can just throw this as a stub into News for mid-June 2019.

## Getting back to Abe

Now that I'm 3D printing again, I can probably get back to printing the case for Abe. Do I need to be so fussy about the anti-static plastic? Can that only be the part for the motherboard? Does it also have to touch the ground underneath it to be safe?

Anyway, in the abstract, I'll be looking to do a "Quadration Primer" some time soon if I decide to get back into Quadration, just to re-familiarize myself.

I was thinking, 'is it possible to parallelize a round of modular squaring?" like, if it's just iterated shifted addition, it would seem like you could probably multi-core the additions

it's, if I'm not mistaken, n^2 complexity, so parallelizing it may actually be worth it

(isn't this just true of modular multiplication, though, which AFAIK is already pretty well-optimized? are there any special tricks we can exploit by having both multiplicands being the same number?)

this might just be an optimization that FPGAs can make

Gotta remember that there's a [Quadration Quest Arc page](0d93d812-6739-4142-9e16-d686e6df00ef.md)

## big picture

I'm still getting married

## A closing thought

As this page is meant to be the "Lenses and Tab Groups" or whatever of these notes (and things I may want to put in these notes):

If Wayside has a method to have template workspace layouts, every editor layout for these notes would start with the editor and preview for The Root Note, and have the editor for Loose Notes, then this page (which, if you want the preview for, you can click through from the Root Note's preview to open it, in a new tab on Theia). Placing ll the rest can be worked out between the first two (and session tracking can work through the third), but it's nice to have Loose Notes there in an emergency (one layer above Google Keep or something).

I think that covers the Great Trifecta: what's Near, what's Far, and what's Around

## foot starts here

Anyway, that's the stuff that I've "got open" right now. Pages covering a broader span of things in my life can be found in the root note, or in [this recap of the first category in slightly more detail](1143ab9b-1442-45da-a800-2a905178e624.md) that used to be the content of this page (inbound links complaining about the redundancy were probably complaining about that, and should be worked out of the tree - specifically, the Right Near Quarters or whatever the Department of Barfspace division for this kind of process should start absorbing some of this meta stuff).

## circled-off section labeled "DO NOT ERASE"

This page ought to be treated as an incubator for content, not as a fixed location to describe any particular thing happening right now.

If a certain ongoing concern has its descriptions laid out best here, they should be split off to a new page, woven into the appropriate channels elsewhere in the Notes, and kept here so long as it is present and relevant (and reevaluated on that criteria regularly, honestly, and without judgment for letting it slip into the rest of the notes)

If a previous state of affairs is worth tracking for historical purposes, please weave it into an oral narrative or at the very least the miscellaneous News page, and move it appropriately (ie. as a linked artifact in said narrative.)

## feel free to link this off and home it someplace under Messays

Remember: the ink hasn't dried on history. What could have been the situation at one point in the past can quickly become the current situation all over again - the trick is to recognize how to separate the abstract states from the specific instances. (This is a very Meditations, Mutations, Metaquiddity type line)

Also, while we're on the subject of historical relevance, this page is basically serving the same role now as Quests did when it was first created: that its role in the notes shifted and is currently kind of fading out is natural, expected, and honestly kind of how I was expecting it all to work when I was originally making it: I knew just writing the stuff down (liknt to Just Writing? I know I've got a page with that name, not sure what it was about) would be enough to plant the seeds for a bunch more stuff that would be more useful, and the fact that some of it switches to the second-person as an artifact of the diaspora is just *exactly* the kind of messiness these notes were designed to accomodate.

## if I'm being honest

I think I had the idea to split items off to separate documents, maybe by UUID even, when I originally did stuartpb.plan, but I thought it was too ambitious and ostentatious (and I might have been spooked at the prospect of making a hierarchy - this split off into the Right Now for These Notes page exploring the nature of newer hierarchies in index pages that's emerging, with Taverns and all)

Another impetus to split pages: GitPod might really struggle saving big buffers (and other implementations could too)?
