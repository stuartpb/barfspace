This is an experiment in using K3OS on an old Chromebook.

- 2019-08-01: [let's try this again, from the top](a2d953f6-a776-468c-a168-ce25df112142.md)
- later: [creation](c83c7062-d45b-411b-9420-0db45f85be2b.md)

This will also probably keep a log of changes made to the machine as a cluster.

## Stuff to explore

I'd like to reflash the machine with a core firmware that doesn't require the user to press Ctrl+D/Ctrl+U to boot.

## Legacy logs

This machine previously hosted an Arch Linux installation known as [stukilla](62907e4e-f535-4676-9863-91c1e3b2eb2d.md)
