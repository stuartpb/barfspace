## How and Why to Build Your Thing Around the Ones Who Will Geek Out Over It

This is where I want to put together my whole philosophy of what *actually matters* when you're making a thing, and how that will lead to success. Notable right now as the location where I've publically posted :family: = :eyes:(:zap::monkey:)Â² + :ear:(:lips:) - :hankey:, which is basically my seven-emoji substitute for reading The Tipping Point.

That bit, originally the "Introduction", is linked here as [Shock the Monkey][].

## Progress

Doesn't contain a *tenth* of the content I want it to have: given a generous publisher's advance, I could write *pages* and ***pages*** of examples of products that have (ostensibly) followed this principle to success ("How The AeroPress Taught Me Everything I Needed to Know To Strike It Big In Silicon Valley, Despite Not Actually Having Done So"), making my dumb little metaphor seem like a law of nature without having to provide a lick of empirically-validated evidence. (When I grow up, I wanna be a pundit, too.)
