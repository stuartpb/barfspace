# Content Editor project ideas

Of one kind or another, here are a few idea clusters I have that could be described as "editors":

## My projects

- [wayside](21af29aa-0dfe-4145-877f-7eb51e38f53e.md)
  - often overlapping [windowsystem metabrowser](20768279-9c6d-4476-90d8-9dd15f3aa4d3.md)
- the [floating pages idea](090b0260-e61d-490d-8031-fa89da8229da.md) is kind of like a Bagtent-y concept
- [penciltape](1c1aa2a1-afe6-458b-8326-54627f9808b2.md)
- [A nice hex editor](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md) (currently entangled with other thoughts)
- [Therblig-based Bot Programmer](cc8a2a69-9df0-4e38-ac66-cb40a9f55531.md) for [robotics](4e40eaae-f191-4c45-a1b7-bc1022f0e210.md)
- [boxesin](171a2617-8920-4ed9-ac6d-6488d023580f.md) was a loose content model that's inspired newer ideas
- [magickshop and/or acebins](553dbec4-e828-4ce7-872b-243f36a0a2c1.md)

## bagtent browsers that may have editing

These were copied from [the bagtent hub](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md), where they relate to notes on [authoring](e1c84681-d395-4533-81c1-233f5bb5bbe3.md) and [navigation/rendering](bf03649f-7721-4d95-af2e-bfe803bf996a.md):

  - [Horus, the Tree Navigation UI for Bagtent](87790b88-2585-4460-921e-a0dec3846b04.md)
  - [Borkflowy, the Bagtent Accordion concept](a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md)
  - [This Bagtent Publisher concept](852e122b-e5af-474a-99c9-31a1d01d0870.md)

## Outside projects

- [existing editors I'm checking out](b39d2df0-1da1-473e-99c3-e2e8b2beeb45.md)

## kind of related

- the [Notestack Core](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) wants a good editor
- [The Clusterhood](9664b592-59ed-4ac5-bf15-9b67f67af111.md) is kind of related, in that it would serve as a host / testbed for these editor projects at an individual scale

## more places to look

Note that the Notestack Core also explores content editing tooling, including smaller-scale experiments like the git shotclock and publishing-side pipeline considerations, and
