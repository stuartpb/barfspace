# My projects in terms of where they sit on the Web Stack

## Using the stack

- [Collective Content Containers](78wkm-ztrw0-fyaxy-96fcq-s27wn)
- [Content Editor Ideas](aamhr-wg63b-cf806-5kx1h-n3g6n), stuff like IDEs

## Nestled within the stack

- [Components, Features, and Parts](sgm3d-n5d7z-ra8jx-4r3y6-cd6rp)

## Behind the stack

- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](ty5xn-fv406-4ya51-2hrm0-84st8)
- [Infrastructure Server Nodes](qf8xs-a6nk5-g18y2-5drdy-rmxrc)

## Aronud the stack

- [Spec brainstorming](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t)

## Way out and above the stack

[Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma) has some higher-level concepts that *sort of* touch my web stack development in some ways.

## Another dimension from the stack

[Community Wishlist](sfwb4-37xeb-42aag-wn5r2-6s2av) contains entities that could be helped by web stuff but it's not a main concern

## Sort of bent at a 45-degree angle

[Browser Extensions](aqwqk-rbhx4-6vanm-hm867-cfewx) are a kind of sideways angle to the web stack.
