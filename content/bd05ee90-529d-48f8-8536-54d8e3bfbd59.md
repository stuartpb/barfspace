# Are We Real?

The question is so irrelevant and stupid. Are we real, or are we just in a simulation?

## blah blah blah

Like, that's conceptually possible, and in any context where you're asking the question, conceptual possibility is, by definition, equivalent

 therefore, by mathematical definition, more real than us.

## The good parts

People always ask me, you know, "Are we real"? And it's like, yeah, okay, you want the answers to reality, go ask someone who works there.
