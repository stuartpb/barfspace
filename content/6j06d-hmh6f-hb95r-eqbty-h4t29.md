I feel like Riotpad or whatever it was worked like this, where you create pages with new random IDs

Also, I'm realizing now that the Dat model works really well for first-level notes, if you want to have a second system for delegating write access and sharing the private keys (and everyone's just trusted to be responsible about writes), or maybe a server has the private key and is authorized
