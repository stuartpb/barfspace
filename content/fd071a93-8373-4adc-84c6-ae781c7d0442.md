# The Rest

This page is meant to be an incubator for pages that don't have a page where they would fit in right now (or pages we just can't figure out what do do with).

## list of pages that defy listing elsewhere

- [this idea for some VR interaction stuff](fc1ed894-b4bb-4e2b-925e-503491970f63.md), not quite a project, but not quite a musing or a shitpost or speculative process
- while we're on the subject, [this page](2e874825-eb8d-4b42-9c31-dfcf4f30a799.md) hasn't really been satisfactorily woven into anywhere yet
- should come to understand [this CSS quirk](01316278-880f-4511-815f-0fa290444e00.md)
- [miscellaneous trivia question ideas](797d6d95-a07c-407f-a1b7-1c89c07bc7ec.md)
- [one way of thinking about the Halting Problem](7d58dbe1-5d51-4ece-a20d-5dd9d197fc5f.md)
- [a tip-of-my-tongue description of something I remember reading a bit of](a2141f2a-0326-44ca-87f4-74ac0dc6613f.md)
  - this should maybe go in a "Lost and Found", where I can keep all kinds of standing things I remember seeing/writing but haven't found
- [an idea for securing .internal domains](b07aa324-ac8d-4b4d-99d2-d0dd11168b4a.md)
- [Why Filenames are the Real Handles](dd41c875-ad64-4ab3-87bf-b9f983d0f788.md)
  - a really useful Linux etal filesystem model concept explainer (ie. "why so many writes are actually renames")
- [extending blocking random with hash material](5f0cc13a-8dc3-421c-a6ee-3b25396470dd.md)
