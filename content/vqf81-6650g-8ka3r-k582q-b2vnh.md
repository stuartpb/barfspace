# How Thought Turns Into Notes Here

I'm gonna see if I can get this page to be the standing center for reflecting on "current state" versus "plans" and "recent developments" - this is something that tends to send me spinning in the [metaquiddity][] vortex, so I tend to get... rambly.

For ways I've gathered my thoughts at points in the past, see [My Thought Collection Process Through the Ages](v8rhb-279v2-mp8k3-v3jd5-wr08h)

A historic note on how this worked, or was supposed to work, at one point has been moved to [here](3nrbf-n69bk-qga59-e1z55-fsa0v).

That note and its scope are being revisited as [The Role of the News Page](8hmvx-jty19-mwap1-c9mzk-5aq0a)

## Modern reflection

My self-teaching [Study Journals](jg1g6-ex272-0h8cp-te3en-0y9cq) are kind of a "raw feed" into the stuff that goes into these notes:

the [Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma), where experimental best practices are drafted, is like the other pole, where experience is thoroughly condensed into whole frameworks.

Eventually, this content ought to re-emerge within [Lean Notes](y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm)

## Other classes of record

There's another page on [Journaling and Checking In](eh2kt-jgmeh-yqag4-yc777-qef0c) under Wellness that covers the kind of stuff that I guess goes in News and Raw and Petlogs and the like?
