I'm particularly looking for "good wipe objects" right now: tall, bulky things that take a lot of filament.

I'm listing that at [Wipe Object Ideas](0qx2w-ggfap-dcaz4-djz80-jb10g)

- ["rock tumbler" print polisher](g9bg0-g9a9c-4b8gb-kan00-23e4h)
- [print-in-place phone dock](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4217552)
  - I actually printed this a couple days ago
    - I still haven't done it with random Z-seam, though
    - That is REALLY necessary for this design to work smoothly, it turns out
      - This should probably be a protip for print-in-place parts in general
      - Either that or the model has actual gearing issues
        - Two remixes have adjusted this:
          - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4358287
          - https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4255418
  - I want to make a USB plug holder for it
    - Noticing now that the raw standoff has its own model
      - Thinking about making a clip that would latch to the unused bottom slot
        - Could hold the cable "up"
  - Thinking I'll try [the jack version](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4217566/files)
- [toy guns](qrs7p-09g36-gkaf3-wwh7n-77cy8)
