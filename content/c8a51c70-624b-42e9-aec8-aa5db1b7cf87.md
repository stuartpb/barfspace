# kubernetes for clusterhood

split off from [my notes on Kubernetes](f7ab56ca-06db-4c96-808f-4d0b0ee47819.md)

each server should have a different runtime/top-level distro, which probably maximizes feature support?

a frakti server seems like the way to allow for traditional VMs running arbitrary machine images, idk

ah, k, yeah okay so every user gets their own Namespace, and maybe we pre-populate that with a "starter" sub-namespace that has a registry pod for the user and other addon stuff like that (like a Heroku clone UI)

hmm, it seems namespaces can't nest? but one can make namespaces that are dotted, if I understand properly, meaning that you can still effectively subdivide a namespace?
