# Notes on Sandstorm

I've been reviewing [Sandstorm](https://github.com/sandstorm-io/sandstorm) and its [tragic](https://sandstorm.io/news/2017-02-06-sandstorm-returning-to-community-roots) [collapse](https://sandstorm.io/news/2018-08-27-discontinuing-free-plan), and have been reflecting on the stuff it got right, and how it got its stuff wrong.

A lot of the other projects I'm wokring on here tie into stuff Sandstorm tried, so it's definitely worth knowing and comparing.

This is similar to a few of the projects I've got in the works, especially Wayside and [Ops in a Box](0dehw-8kxsa-81amj-gp4kk-td8cw)
