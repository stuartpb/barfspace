# The Notestack Engineering Core

This group has split off from the [Department of Barfspace](eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md), as the DoB hold jurisdiction over the content of the notes, and the NEC don't generally interact with the notes' content, except where said content is informed by implementation details.

They might end up finding some common ground in the [Barfspace Scope Oracle](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), though (or whatever ends up growing out of those quests).

See also the [general hub for notes on bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md).

## Mostly-finished Missions

(there's always a little more followthrough to do, but, you know, I'm too much of a slacker to do extra credit and all)
