# Inlining Links in Bagtent

TODO: figure out why I used to be so allergic to this

One of the places where inline links definitely make more sense is for lists, where moving items from page to page doesn't require moving multiple pieces of data.

This might have been an idea about how those references wouldn't need to be trucked around manually, but... why rely on the tooling to do this for you? you're *already* seeing what a pain in the ass this is when you don't have it. One of the principles of [Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) is that you should design around the things that are the least pain in the ass with the broadest range of MacGyver-like circumstances
