# throwaway plot idea

a far-future Indiana Jones who's interested in finding artifacts from the 20th century, like The White Album of Ringo Starr (copy #0000001)

people are like "The Dark Star of White Ringu" or whatever, it's just meaningless thrown-together words for them

## expanded a little

Like, you really could do something with all the artifacts of 60s and 70s music and weed strains, even just around The Beatles.

and of course Once Upon a Time in the Shaolin was designed to be like the ne plus ultra of this

## a bit I posted to Twitter
