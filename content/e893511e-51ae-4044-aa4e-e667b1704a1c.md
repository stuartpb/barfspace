# New Project Triage Methods

This is my thought on best practices for establishing a new, underdefined common interface, like Bagtent or CommonMark or Kubernetes.

## Recognize What People Want And Set Some Ground Rules

Like, if you know the spec will probably need an extension for something (like spoilers, or a common set of links), you can lay down some "here's what will probably be easily be compatible with whatever comes next, here's what will leave you with a mismatched model in a world of pain"

like, start outlining some common practices *early*. not only does this help your spec when you eventually do design it, it tells people what that spec will look like, and how not to design an implementation

also collect ideas people have, you know? start talking about what possible solutions would conflict with other use cases.

remembering here that the Method Lab should probably link in the Specs Laws page, maybe as a tavern? it's certainly informal enough to collect the kinds of stubs that it would naturally connect?

(I made a subpage for that last thought, it's in the Method Lab right now)

## this isn't just code

this can also apply to forming a new collective organization
