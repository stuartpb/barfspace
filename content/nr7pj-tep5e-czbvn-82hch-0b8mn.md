# Professional Helmbags

These are [Helmbags](mtwmg-gw5d6-m5a4q-ded6h-dkz12) for charts that a whole person would "need to be able to do their job".

This is a broad category that overlaps with a few others, but it still has some unique entries

## Technical-user

- [System Administration Helmbags](3x3ew-aknad-rw94y-dnsms-s1ebp)
- [Development Suite Helmbags](dbnj4-sjs7p-jsbay-1gztb-refwj)

## Office suite

- mintable for accounting (instead of Quickbooks or whatever)
- some spreadsheet app
  - there was that one that I think was in Rust, backend-only? could be compiled for WASM and hooked into a frontend engine?
  - whatever goes here, add a thing to mintable to integrate it
- see [Plain Old File-Friendliness](hbn7h-zmwqr-m4aaz-zd6xb-f8y0d) for "Google Drive"

a lot of this other stuff

## Creativity suite

Getting real pie-in-the-sky here, I don't know if there are truly good offerings

- Video editor
- Vector image editor
- Raster image editor

## Logistics person

- [Logistics Helmbags](6jdr2-b29s6-83bwk-ecvfq-fqz02)
  - might also interact with Metrics (currently classified under [System Administration](3x3ew-aknad-rw94y-dnsms-s1ebp))
