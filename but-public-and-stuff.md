i love the idea of a blog where all the posts are just not even finished or in any kind of order and constantly changing, like even live-updating

but you need access to the history, because "why the fuck does it look like this" is such a common question when you've got a folder you've overwritten stuff in with no time blocked out to ensure you finish your thoughts / editing sometimes, where work goes for several years, you need to be able to put it into context to be able to pick the threads up again, that's what I've gotten out of GitHub

aside: this is why I FUCKING HATE when people think Git is a synchronization tool and not a VCS, it's like, they've never recognized the power of context that historical metagata gives you, they're blind to the larger narratives that inform DOING SMART FUCKING WORK
