# On a Dark And Stormy Night You Can See Forever

General Stanley came in to find Jason innput frantically scribbling down thoughts. "How's the spell going?" he asked.

"I haven't started!"

"You haven't started? Jason, the intel we're getting, command is expecting we might have to perform this ritual as early as *tomorrow*."

"I can't concentrate over the roaring of this goddamned infernal engine!"

Stanley's eyes narrowed, worriedly. "Are you talking about..." He searched "The crickets?"

"Holy holly hell! Buddy... the *engine!* The engine behind the walls! The engine behind our *eyes*!"

"If you think any of this sounds crazy, I want to know what part of an iron bar spinning in mid-air of its own accord to accuse a stuffed bunny rabbit constitutes 'sane'."

"I just... wanted to make sure you're not about to snap and start bleeding swastikas and jizzing revenge."

Once Stanley left, taking the bottle with him, Jason moved the dresser aside to consult the square covered in crosses that he'd carved into the wall.
