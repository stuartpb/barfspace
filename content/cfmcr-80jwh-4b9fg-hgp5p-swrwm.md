# The Dark Side

This is a [Lean Notes page](y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm) with no Before or After, because it should not be visited unless something has gone wrong.

## Overture

Protip: Avoid The Dark Side.

> **Yoda:** If once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny, consume you it will, as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
>
> **Luke:** Vader... Is the dark side stronger?
>
> **Yoda:** No, no, no. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
>
> **Luke:** But how am I to know the good side from the bad?
>
> **Yoda:** You will know... when you are calm, at peace, passive. A Jedi uses the Force for knowledge and defense, *never* for attack.

The patterns described here aren't like the things that are "not recommended" in the introduction. The things that are "not recommended" are burdensome, but they can be overcome.

Doing these will ultimately hurt you. The short-sighted gains you get from doing this stuff tend to hide one big Tragedy of the Common. Relying on the mistaken thought patterns described in this section can *kill* a product.

If you want evidence that the shit here is bad, you just need to look at the kind of person who would recommend you add them: they're all MBAs and other capitalist parasites.

## Cheap/Mass Labor

**Fiverr** is an abomination. The idea that you're paying for "work" on Fiverr is essentially a lie. Other than users who will sell acting / voiceovers, the users on Fiverr are literally just running a program they bought with the input you give them and reselling the result.

The whole "just outsource to somewhere where you can get labor at extortionate rates!" plan is a dud:

It's important to recognize that this is *skilled labor*.

The Mythical Man Month is all about why this is a terrible idea. Here's another article (which also ends on the subject of how offshoring is a bust):

Thinking you can do better by hiring new programmers is about as stupid as thinking you'll go faster by putting two people at the same keyboard.

## Dark Patterns

As collected at http://darkpatterns.org/

A lot of "Search Engine Optimization" boils down to introducing a bunch of gross artificial dark patterns to imitate the organic structures (ie. astroturfing) that search engines use to discern quality websites. (Over )

Advertising is almost exclusively deceptive in the internet age where people talk directly to each other (see The Cluetrain Manifesto for more, and see Selling to Help for a counterpoint). The more tech savvy install ad blockers anyway.

Note that much of SEO entails hiring a legion of spammers.

Automating Social Media is another dumb idea. http://thefuturebuzz.com/2011/09/29/ragu-pasta-sauce-social-media/

There's nothing *social* about having a *robot pretend to be a person*. Have some dignity. Re-read the Cluetrain Manifesto.

Outsourcing Social Media to people who aren't involved with your thing is another boneheaded idea. If people who aren't actually involved with your product are the ones in charge of talking about it, what does that say about your product?

Outsourced social media, or "Social Media" positions in general, is a recipe for mindless disaster, humiliation, and embarrassment, like when Kevin Butler retweeted the signing key for the PS3, or when DiGiorno described their pizza like it was a reason to stay in an abusive relationship.

These positions are created to exploit the Fear Of Missing Out in people who think they can't understand social media. Hiring them gives you nothing to gain, and everything to lose.

## Lazy Money

Protip: Ads are bad. They don't work and are usually AdBlocked anyway.

Nagging people to pay you or disable their ad blocker isn't a good idea, either. http://tabcloseddidntread.com/

## Delusion

If things aren't going the way you'd hoped, be careful that you don't start focusing on ways to *delude yourself or others that the problem isn't important*.

One of the clearest signs that an org is avoiding confronting their root issues is when they start shifting the focus to **optimization**, the eking out of marginal wins being thrown like a tablecloth to distract from an overall concession of failure. Micro-optimization, in both your code and your design, should be avoided. Getting hyper-immersed in A-B testing stuff is a great way to miss the forest for the trees.

http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/22/magazine/a-sucker-is-optimized-every-minute.html

The worst thing about this kind of optimization is that it has a tendency to make you see things you don't do, because you have respect for your users and for yourself, as *weaknesses*, showing you how being *this much* more manipulative will give you *this much* of an increase in user signups.

Once again: *Quicker. Easier. More seductive*.
