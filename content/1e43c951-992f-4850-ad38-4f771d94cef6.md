# Gaming Helmbags

[Casual Helmbags](61d67fab-ee81-440b-8ede-a8650f168daa.md) specifically oriented around gameplay

## Minecraft Suite

- The Minecraft server
- Any popular addons?

## Steam / RetroArch?

- Something like Internet Archive's emulator setup
- Could this even, for emus that run better native, handle save file / cheat / mod synchronization across systems somehow?
  - Would that lock things into one specific emulator implementation that's likely not-as-easily-WASMable?
    - I mean, that's kind of the point
- What about Steam and adding cloud support to non-steam-API games
  - Integrating with an outside Syncthing?
