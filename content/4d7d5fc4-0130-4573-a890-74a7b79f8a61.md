# Something like a smart editor authoring plugin

You know, turning `"` into ldquo and rdquo, things like that.

I'm also thinking it could convert hyphen-minus to hyphen characters by an automatic rule if the two surrounding characters are words

(and, like, if you're typing a formula using keywords/dx-style variables, )

## blip

is that a thing in Haskell, a variable that can be used as a function that multiplies to the right?

## UI affordances

- It'd have checkboxes for "ASCIIfy copied content" and "Highlight smartified characters"
