# Plain Old File-Friendliness Helmbags

this is wild-planning for a Helmbag that'd cover "File Services"

## something like Google Drive

- notes on endpoints this'd need to provide:
  - the other apps should be able to use it as some kind of shared backend
  - should have something akin to Google apps' "share as link"
    - this would necessitate the external host integration, of course
  - a distributed backend for this would be great
    - especially if it's designed for open distribution/replication like Dat
    - maybe PouchDB?
      - at that point this is as much about a "common document store" as a fileserver

maybe that's just what this

this overlaps a lot of the storage concerns in [Technical Helmbags](a39sa-qmz8m-6r8cs-62h3v-3ve8v)

## Extremely Simple Web Hosting

This is another goal: to get experiences of Web publishing as simple as Dropbox's Public Folder.

- You could even have "insert a flash drive to bring the contents of the drive online"
  - but now we're getting into App Idea territory

Continues as [Static-Site-Hosting Helmbag(s)](g36tn-ymx54-g092c-a38vs-pvg20)
