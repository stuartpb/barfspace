# Operation and configuration of a sufficiently-advanced "did you mean" feature

there's a prompt that defaults to "no", options are "no" (the default), "yes" (), "suggest" (which just prints, like Git's default), "presume" which can take a list of commands it's safe to presume, `window` which gives a window to hit Yes to correct (and can take a list), `countdown` which gives a window to hit no to cancel (and can take a list)

have an option for whether the countdown should update after being printed, if there's a countdown

maybe some kind of way to structure this, like maybe it's comma-separated-list-of-commands-that-can-include-wildcards,equals,option,colon,time(which can go with "yes" or "no", so "presume" and "suggest" are just wordy aliases for "yes:0" and "no:0", and then countdown and window are respective aliases that have some sort of default (maybe there's a thing that lets you set aliases, like maybe I want to configure "fastcount" and "slowcount" for "yes:3" and "no:10"

Actually, it's important to establish here that, in these examples, "yes" and "no" need to consistently refer to whether they're giving a *window* in which to hit enter/space to, or whether it's a countdown until that default happens

maybe that's the ticket, you're specifying the default with "enter:yes" or "space:yes" or "enter:no" or "space:no", where space is normally no... the layout is

maybe it needs to go like CSS where it supports two contradictory specification styles, "countdown:10,yes:space" or "window:10,enter:no"

nah, it should go:

- time of countdown
- what option will be picked if the countdown ends
- what hitting enter does
- what hitting space does

because, remember, all of these accept "yes" and "no", and these are all valid combinations. so I guess then the order for normalcy would be:

- 'n' for if enter and space default "no", 'y' for if enter and space default "yes", 'yn' for if enter means 'yes' but space means "no" (maybe "window" is a synonym for this), 'ny' for if enter means no but space means yes (and "countdown" is a synonym for this)
- countdown defaults to what space does (and space can also be specified as "y:n" or "n:y" kinds of things, where "y:y" and "n:n" just give the same effect as y
- this means default for a countdown, if you're just specifying a duration, can be specified like "y:10" or "10:y"

time is interpreted as seconds unless it ends with "ms" in which case it's parsed as milliseconds

anyway this would have to also have an option that's just "prompt" which only takes y/n literally (or maybe a list of aliases for each? hmm, is there a way that can make sense in the "menu")
