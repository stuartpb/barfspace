## April 2019

- [Opinion: We Built A Broken Internet. Now We Need To Burn It To The Ground.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikemonteiro/we-built-a-broken-internet-now-we-need-to-burn-it) Basically a Thomas Friedman article about the need to replace Twitter with Mastodon. A white guy taking the observation everybody on Twitter has been making for years (the site sucks because it was made by white guys, for white guys) and tries to pass it off as his own bold call to action. No real suggestions for *how* we might do that, though. He's an *ideas* guy, you see.
- [I am not always very attached to being alive](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation), a great article about living with suicidal ideation
- [The Woman Who Rewrote Me](https://electricliterature.com/the-woman-who-tried-to-rewrite-me/) (note: article is about a deeply abusive relationship)
- [The Curse of the Diaeresis](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis), or, Why The New Yorker Will Never Stop Doing That Pretentious Thing With the Dots

## May 2019

- [A Conspiracy to Kill IE6](http://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6): How a few rogue YouTube engineers started a browser revolution. A pretty salient account of one of the Web's greatest tipping points in history.
- [About Face](https://popula.com/2019/02/24/about-face/), an illustrated reflection on the normalization of paramilitary/fascist iconography in American culture
- [Verge explainer on Avengers: Endgame](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537370/avengers-endgame-questions-answered-black-widow-tony-stark-captain-america-how-does-time-travel-work) - most notable for aggregating how much the movie's creators don't agree on some basic logical shit
- [Programming: doing it more vs. doing it better](https://kevinmartinjose.com/2019/04/08/programming-doing-it-more-vs-doing-it-better/) - an endorsement, then rebuttal, of the "do it more and get better at it" philosophy. Starts with a neat anecdote that's lifted directly from Jeff Atwood (with citation).
- [Minecraft Classic](https://classic.minecraft.net/) - okay, this isn't so much a "read" as it is a "visit for ten seconds", but I'm putting it here because meh, why not
- [Microsoft's looking to bring back PowerToys, this time on GitHub.](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys) Huzzah.

## June 2019

- ['It's a miracle': Helsinki's radical solution to homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness). Turns out, if you don't put a bunch of bullshit conditions on "deserving" homeless, you solve the problem. *Who could have guessed?*
- [The Surreal End of an American College](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/06/what-its-like-when-your-college-shuts-down/591862/), for if you want to be miserable about collapsing institutions that served a social purpose. (There's maybe optimism about the opening this creates, ie. much cheaper online education, but that's also... a vulturous space of predation and cut corners. Gross "entrepreneur" land. Something to reflect on in [Notes to the Left](d601d7ba-522b-4d6d-9e3b-101885e7aa00.md).)
- Someone posted [this logic puzzle](http://nautil.us/blog/-the-logic-puzzle-you-can-only-solve-with-your-brightest-friend) to Meh
  - Following the links from that article and exploring the class of problem more, I've made [this page](6c383b1d-bea5-4652-a1f0-9d207b47461b.md) to cover it
  - [This article about the social striation of rhotics](http://nautil.us/blog/why-the-r-sound-became-a-famous-social-differentiator), and how it's like the US version of Eliza Doolittle's Cockney accent, was interesting. *There's a four-day rhotic conference!*
  - I also stumbled into [this article about eating jellyfish](https://horizon-magazine.eu/article/jellyfish-researchers-want-you-start-thinking-about-these-creatures-your-next-meal.html)
  - [This article about Fourier transforms](http://nautil.us/blog/-the-math-trick-behind-mp3s-jpegs-and-homer-simpsons-face) got me to understand the concept better than anything I've read before
  - Clicking around from there got me Mathloger's video explaining the Homer visualization, which, eh, I don't feel was worthwhile enough for me to go find the link to it right now
  - I got [this video on the Los Angeles Reservoir's "shade balls"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxPdPpi5W4o) as a suggestion, which was a neat exploration of... kind of the kind of stuff you can expect to have to see more of in the Anthropocene
  - A suggestion on that video led me to [this video on Dr. Nim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KABcmczPdg), a rudimentary mechanical device which can win at Nim (the game where two players take turns taking one to three tokens).
  - This sent me down the rabbit hole of other Stand Up Maths videos that are right up my alley: I sought out [this video where they made a binary adder out of dominoes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpLU__bhu2w)
  - Clicking through led to [this great deep dive on why NTSC isn't quite 60 frames per second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GJUM6pCpew)
  - [This video on Scutoids](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_NZ1ql8B8Y) has me thinking about ways to structure thick meshes effectively - probably out of my wheelhouse, but it (and the pages the cideo links to) are good constructions to keep in your pocket
  - Now I'm watching [this long old thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwEYamjXpA)
- [The Last White House Press Secretary](https://www.truthdig.com/articles/the-last-white-house-press-secretary/), a reflection on how terrible the role has always been, and how the worst person to ever hold the role was probably summarily the best *at* it.

## July 2019

- [It’s Time for a Modern Synthesis Kernel](https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1676) - A fun little recap of JIT techniques, and how everybody but TempleOS has largely overlooked them for kernel code.
- [This Is Going to Get Worse.](https://thebaffler.com/latest/this-is-going-to-get-worse-burmila)
- [What Happens When Lyme Disease Becomes an Identity?](https://www.thecut.com/2019/07/what-happens-when-lyme-disease-becomes-an-identity.html)
  - Deer ticks are the new Thetans.

This is a core element to what resonates in this article: this horseshit stems from Boomers being just *so goddamn fucking pathologically afraid of addressing mental health issues*

>  I knew that mental-health diagnoses were a difficult subject among chronic-Lyme patients; non-Lyme doctors who suggested a psychiatric basis for symptoms were a source of profound frustration. Such suggestions were understood to translate directly as *All in your head, so get over it.* There seemed to exist no acknowledgment that a patient in the grip of a major depressive episode might be unable to think straight, unable to move, unable to get out of bed — nor that telling such a patient to just snap out of it would be as useless as telling a flu patient to try having less of a fever.

## September 2019

- [Trump Is Not Well](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/) - thias is a very "yeah, no shit" column
