# Setting up a base authentication layer

This would be most useful for making the Kubernetes Dashboard less of a pain in the ass, but it'd also be useful

This will need:

- If using GitHub authentication:
  - External ingress (so the GitHub OAuth server can reach it)
- If using some other form of authentication, like an internal user database:
  - ???
- In any case:
  - Dex
  - cert-manager?
  - probably household DNS?
