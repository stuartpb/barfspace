# stuzzy

(Not to be confused with "stuzee", the machine name for my old HP Touchsmart TX2Z running Windows 7.)

## old note about name discrepancy in early entries

Currently, the changes listed in this repo describe an installation that was going to be called "stukilla", as a Mark II of the previous "stukilla".

However, I'm now planning on running a new installation *on the same machine that hosted the previous stukilla* and having it keep that name, so I chose, when rebuilding this system, to give it an all-new title.

## YAML metadata stuff

why is this, like, the only YAML metadata block to use a tag instead of a different field? *who knows, this data was pointless* - this will probably be turned into page structures (ie. different indices) in the post-merger

also I don't think this is even valid YAML since the machine-id isn't quoted and starts with a digit

```yaml
hostname: stuzzy
machine-id: 8c1f1314f3d4485a9b647ea2c5a1c36e
distro: archlinux
processor: x64
chassis: laptop
tags: [chromebook]
```
