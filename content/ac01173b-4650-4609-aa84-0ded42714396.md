# ![Tag: Chapter Link][] Table B: A staged linear flow

Sorted by most of the section's content. Since Lean Notes is written with a flow more like [Table A][] in mind, the sections aren't strictly laid out like this (education will still have some action a lot of the time). However, there's usually an overall zeitgeist to what a board describes happening.
