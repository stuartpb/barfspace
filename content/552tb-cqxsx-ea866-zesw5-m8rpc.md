# The Arecibo Notes

This page is for a condensed page of notes I can hang in the back of the theater as Dotsies, for cues on the tightest pieces that I don't have the capacity to demonstrate.

There should be another level of script from this for Bell to read from in the act, so I can query "what comes next after X"
