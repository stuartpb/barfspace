# Horror Nights build notes

Fed up with spotty connections, I decided to replace the previous necklace strip with a new one that I wouldn't mangle as much.

Anyway, this new strip has just about as many spotty connections, so I guess that's just inevitable unless you go with a flex strip (all the more reason to consider that as the base for a future iteration)

I ended up breaking the first LED's connection to the rest of the strip somehow (I've forgotten exactly what I did)
