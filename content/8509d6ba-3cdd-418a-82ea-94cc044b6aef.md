# Project Idea Incubator

This is *far* from a comprehensive list of all my project ideas: *that* list is up on https://unusual.studio/projects.

However, sometimes that page needs a place to reference project ideas, and sometimes, those project ideas live here:

- [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) (the tools and spec that govern barfspace itself)

- [penciltape](1c1aa2a1-afe6-458b-8326-54627f9808b2.md)
- [Tabalanche](1bba5664-3cd1-4f22-903b-fd35c6844ac0.md)

- [A nice hex editor](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md)
- [Windowsystem Metabrowser](20768279-9c6d-4476-90d8-9dd15f3aa4d3.md)
- [NilPass](7e171d29-590d-4636-9c2e-80cdaef10e92.md) (currently largely Quests-oriented)
- [Therblig-based Bot Programmer](cc8a2a69-9df0-4e38-ac66-cb40a9f55531.md)

This list is getting unwieldy... maybe time to start grouping them / moving them out, with an LFG Tavern Page at the end like how Lean Notes and Messays are moving toward?

## Other Kinds of Project

Stuff I do that involves work like circuits and 3D Printing live in the [Makey Projects][] page. (This page might end up just becoming a superpage above that one, and most of the items here would be moved to a Software Projects page, which would get listed here along with Big Titles and [game projects](47a84b6f-b858-4064-9563-00230ab4c1e5.md) and maybe Junkyard Daydreams)

[Makey Projects]: b2694758-f919-4d46-a29b-7bbf189eab38.md

Note there are similar refactors like this going on in the notes right now, see [this page](9d2999b6-8d6d-417b-9a60-36df93a05192.md) for whatever Department of Barfspace institution ends up springing up to describe this phenomenon like Project Akira or Operation Trapper Keeper

So yeah, from that reflection, I'm thinking, group a few of these into (redundancy-permitting) groups like Devops Stuff, Abstract Frameworks (for Plushu and Bagtent and, in other senses, many of these - overlapping Spec Lab some), Browser Extensions, (Web) Apps (which can be further sectioned out however - see the thing I just tacked on there, link to be placed here later - about the two-level rule-of-thumb), and then you can have those other types of project, and then you can have the Soft Project Tavern (for any GitHub-and-not-Markdown/Fountain-or-Hard-Project project) to absorb the rest of the unaffiliated Soft Projects listed here now (maybe listed at the bottom of a Soft Projects Page inheriting the nodules for these current links), and then an Ultimate Project Far Out Tavern at the Edge of the Concept Space for anything that doesn't fit neatly into a group that can link from this level Project superindex.

## more other stuff

[Big Titles](e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md) are pages that are designed to become massive repositories of writing (even if that doesn't so much shake out in practice). They're kind of like writing projects.

For other context that *might* explain some of these, see [Right Now][] and [News][].

[Right Now]: 41218b84-cd08-48a5-b91a-865e8b90c46a.md
[News]: afcfaa78-ef7e-429e-a2ea-0b5c7abaf7b7.md

It's important to note that the UUIDs used *here* have no relation to the UUIDs used elsewhere (ie. for reference in Unusual Studio) - a UUID refers either to a project listing there, or a document here. Any project that's listed both here *and* there is going to have two separate UUIDs, [and that's the way it should be](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/8).
