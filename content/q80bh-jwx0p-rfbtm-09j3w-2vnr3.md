# bagtent

This is an index page for pages that talk about bagtent, ie. the tooling and structure of these notes

Most of these are carried out by the [Notestack Engineering Core](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma), who also handle non-bagtent related projects for my notes (like the Git commit shotclock).

## historical remark

this ought to be incorporated into whatever history of bagtent/barfspace+LN/notes.stuartpb.com is drafted: https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/issues/3 was where I originally came up with the architecture

also, I think there might be an artifact about [Lean Notes][]' original README? I might have gone ahead and broken that down though. The one that described the repo's layout? I think all the content from the old Lean Notes readme has been dispersed one way or another

## Related

[The Academy](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j) collects documents about the structuring of these notes, which is heavily informed by bagtent.

[Worse is Better](hp3rj-bp2vq-059k3-ge144-a3tcv) collects reflections on organic tendencies that play around the design of bagtent

The organic junction that is [The Oozy Sewer](6yanh-hg3gd-s69sp-wyba4-qgkgt) lies somewhere between those two and this page - probably more between this one and the Academy (hence why this page will probably become the University of Bagtent and this page can maybe get a catchier name - maybe "The Institute of Notanicus", that sounds suitably insane for these notes)

## Related Tools

Lots of the Notestack Engineering stuff is relevant to bagtent, but [git-shotclock and its interface for loose integration with bagtent-orphans](vwjtn-pkzhg-gc9ff-2h6sj-nddpy) is close enough that I feel it's appropriate to link here.
