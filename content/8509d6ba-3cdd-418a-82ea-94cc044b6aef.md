# The BarfSpace Incubator&trade;

This is *far* from a comprehensive list of all my project ideas: *that* list is up on https://unusual.studio/projects.

However, sometimes that page needs a place to reference project ideas, and sometimes, those project ideas live here:

- [timetress][]
- [Universal Issue Tracker][]
- [The Clusterhood][perfect-workspace.md]
- [Ultimate Secret Trump][]

It's important to note that the UUIDs used *here* have no relation to the UUIDs used elsewhere (ie. for reference in Unusual Studio) - a UUID refers either to a project listing there, or a document here. Any project that's listed both here *and* there is going to have two separate UUIDs, [and that's the way it should be](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/8).
