# a thought about Stubernetes storage classes

(popping off from a list on [this massive thought balloon](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md))

Yes, there should be a "work" class, and a "bulk" class
  - "Bulk" meaning "blobs from the Great Bulk"
    - which is a nameless idea I've got another page around for The Information Blob or whatever
    - but it refers to data that uses a DHT-like model or whatever
