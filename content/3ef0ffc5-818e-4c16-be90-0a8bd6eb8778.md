# The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity

Careening like a tire on fire out from https://github.com/unusualstudio/unusualstudio-projects/issues/14#issuecomment-359223134

This is one of the hardest traps my brain falls into, like the robots in Futurama (which inherited this gag from Star Trek) all being fundamentally susceptible to destruction when encountering paradoxes:

When I find myself considering *what it is that I'm considering*, and whether I'm considering that - and how to *convey* the consideration of trying to find the words to describe trying to find words to describe... (repeat ad infinitum)

This relates to the wat that the worst feeling is [forgetting what you were about to tell yourself not to forget](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ScbIldQpFy4), or what you were trying to remember.

Hopefully I can now bail out to pointing to this file, and not get caught up in whether or not it *is* this file that I should be pointing to... (the more complicated that decision is, the more evidence that this is, in fact, the file to be pointing to)

The vertigo of staring into infinity is one thing, but the confusion of *struggling with the concept of struggling with concepts*, woven with the comprehension of the recursion, confusion, complexity, fractality, the general tesselation and [hyperoperation][] and scope-jumping of all the manners in which the question can be *rotated*, just compounds the loopiness *so much more*

[hyperoperation]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperoperation

related: the exasperation of knowing there's a whole noumenon, a whole school of concepts that I can't access, just because I can't recall or ascertain the correct terms to search for to find an adjacent article - this is a feeling I have with Alphabinary Encoding particularly, that someone out there *must* have had the idea before me, and written more about it than I have, but I can't find it because the vocabulary I'm using to describe it doesn't match the vocabulary *they* used to describe it, so we're two ships passing in the night in terms of Google search results

new since moving to bagtent: I'm freaking out right now about making a page for prospective index pages, on which my first link would be a page linking to pages that index by "mood", and it's like, is that a redundant level? I think I was going to do a change at one point and make [Appendices][] into "Indices and Appendices" but chickened out because that was kind of redundant with the README, so I put it into [The Rest][] because it was basically "where am I going to put things I don't want to put on the main README but don't have a reason to hang them later", which is essentially what I was thinking having what we might then call "Further Indices and Appendices" be (or maybe the page is called "Further -Ices" and "Indices" and "Appendices" are subheadings)

Anyway, I'm on track to making The Rest basically obsolete (two things on it, I can move waxhead-revisited to Angst and/or Tumblr or a bunch of places)
