# Barfspace Office of Construction Plans

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way:

- [Reworking Right Now / News / Quests / Projects][rn-rework] on the Right Now page
- Plans to rework The Rest, Appendices, and Loose Notes (and maybe more?) on [The Rest][]

[rn-rework]: 41218b84-cd08-48a5-b91a-865e8b90c46a.md#plans-for-this-institutionalized-with-this-structure
[The Rest]: ff47c3c8-6686-4225-ba27-23f61c604e0d.md

Usually, these plans should be reacted on promptly, but sometimes it's nice to just think it out over the course of a few documented commits before going forward with it. Bottom line, we do *not* want a situation where plans to act are enshrined and action itself is feared.

Actually let's go ahead and just loop those plans into here right now
