# Series of writeups on my crypto components

or whatever you'd call them.

The narrative order I'm thinking would make sense:

- Hashblot
- [OPWS](144ec8bd-d6cb-47b7-aa60-7220f6d5b4f2.md)
- NilPass
- Surpass (especially Gross Simplification)
- Hashsplat
- Alphabinary

## What for?

This could lead into a Technical Content application to [Mozilla](0da88c9b-a01f-4303-9868-0aab47ae8bbc.md).

This could also onboard people to the [Hall of Champions](d02fb1fb-3fff-4ca0-a26c-bf82e6f20e46.md).
