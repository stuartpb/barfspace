# features I'd like in a streaming-torrent-box platform or app or whatever

- everything is a torrent. like, that's the native data structure. it's the only way to import: you give it a magnet link
  - this could maybe be expanded to the other distributed filesystems like Dat and IPFS
  - torrents are, at some level, indexed by content, right?
  - or, like, anyway, torrents are the current most common publication format
    - you could maybe have a torrent-to-ipfs gateway
      - but, like, I don't think you can make IPFS all that
        - hence why
  - point is, they're immutable
    - and it's all under one natural DHT namespace, right?
      - like I don't have to run yet another etcd cluster to maintain the state
        - I suppose this would mean Kubernetes might have a custom Torrent resource, then?
          - the Torrent having a PersistentVolumeClaim, and the node currently responsible for it
            - and I guess that would let Kubernetes balance the torrents based on
        - oof, but, like, even in a namespace, isn't that putting a lot of
          - does this maybe need... its own control plane?
            - if you connect that subcluster's API server to a Pod in the "main cluster"
          - I'm realizing now that this might be an example of how "bulk" and "work" classes might get separated...
            - oh man, yeah, that impacts the design of my personal storage
              - like, what if you want to run Longhorn instances
                - Actually, can they share a physical volume?
                  - since I'm not doing this for any overlapping storage media, I'm gonna operate on the assumption they can for now
                    - And, you know, I'm not mounting multiple Longhorn instances to the same class of drive right now because it's a simple cluster
  - and you know their size
    - or at least, you don't have to download anything before you know its size
      - awesome how this technically-useful information comes as a consequence of the natural design of the protocol
- announce lists.
  - this of course couldn't be a torrent (though it could be a .dat)
  - every
  - this also makes it so that things like patreon-only podcasts, that you wouldn't naturally want to pirate, should be made private some way
    - tracker authentication?
    - you could also just have secret magnet links that are excluded from sync / publication / export
      - you could even do this like Humble Bundle, which provides a native torrent transfer
