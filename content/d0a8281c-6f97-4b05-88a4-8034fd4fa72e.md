# The Inline Rock

This was [the addition I made](c51673dd-b4ad-4ce2-895d-6a43fbd5b933.md) to [the old recommendation for footnames](7f3d8fbc-67ba-4267-902e-f9628207d18f.md) that caused me to rethink the whole idea:

> I just wrote the Table of Contents for [Understanding Lua][], and I didn't even bother coming up with footnames for most of them - I just used inline links, since most of them were one-time and the name level of redirection didn't really help readability.

## Also

This list was pulled from [an old page calling for the collection of best practices](2015dc83-db74-4f1f-a089-d07c3bd38dc1.md)

- Actually, inline links have a lot of advantages:
  - Don't need to worry about locality.
  - Don't need to (possibly) update footnames if you change the text in a link.
  - I think there might be more notes on this lingering around somewhere, I'll just remember to direct them here or to a subpage about it at some point in the future

These should really be moved into the modern page on [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md)
