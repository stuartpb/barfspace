## Previously

[Monetizing and Accounting](cpqbk-avea2-ab8fg-m2m7b-c28pj) was previous in the "linear flow" that just tried to weave the pages together (having Accounting in place does make it easier to reimburse your human workers).

## Overture

Not everything calls for a program. Some things just need that bedside manner and human touch: other things are just too tricky for even the current state of the art in neural networks to handle.

## Outsourcing Simple Tasks

(Protip/warning: recommending outside commercial service dependencies here. All the usual caveats and precautions apply.)

- Mechanical Turk
- CrowdFlower (is that even still a thing?)

## Moderators

See [Implementing User Accounts](rt4ha-04jzn-wm9m5-6q6kc-sqfcm) for how to handle permissions from a technical perspective.

## Scaling Humans

Sometimes you want to gravitate away from people; smoetimes you have to hire more.

(Not sure where I was going with this: maybe just that one should be conscious of how they're structuring their team? Maybe HR stuff?)
