# problem hub for Stushiba

Stushiba is subject to some of what's listed on [the general papercuts hub](d07f30ca-f065-4fb7-9541-b09b656313c5.md)

## but especially on stushiba

## another problem essentially caused by all-repo-fonts

Chrome has been hitching. Turns out it's because [it's processing every font on the system, for some reason](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=904994), of which I have like a thousand because I have the entire Google Fonts repository installed. Considering switching to Firefox until this issue is fixed. (Found through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/9wnur4/chromium_and_googlechrome_lag_problem/) Reddit thread.)

## Not that everything's rosy on the other side

- Firefox on Stushiba seems to be tearing when scrolling / watching Netflix
  - https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1315230 covers some vsync issues
