# My Perfect Workspace World: The Clusterhood

## plan to use my CNCF credit on Packet to work

- [other root OS exploration](9yk3d-nants-j7ax1-af3mn-n1rm5)
- [work on something better than k3s](r4598-4w62m-w29dv-rkvf4-cvdc4)

essentially, the Packet thing can become my lab for a k3s / CoreOS replacement, as well as new-Plusku/printacle/Server Thing, and everything in between

this isn't *quite* Clusterhood? But it's... practice for what I'd want the Clusterhood to be like
