# The Hall of Champions

This'll be a note page where I list pages for projects / ideas that could use someone else interested in them, asking me about them, posting about them, finding other people who might want to work on them, etc.

To build this out to a generalizable structure, I've got a page for the [Request for Producers Community](49561f8d-d2d5-42b7-ac0a-d22683a1f0c3.md)

## Thoughts on this

This might make sense conjoined with the Unusual Studio projects list (I'm thinking as a side repo to the Projects repo, at the moment)?

Meh... I think it'd be best to just have it loose for now - the projects index as it is now, with its UUIDs, was pretty much just made
