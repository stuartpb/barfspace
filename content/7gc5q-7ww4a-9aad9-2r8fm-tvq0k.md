# A minimal subset of the DOM

Something I could really use for [hashsplat](jbe6d-x93w1-wgard-3b32k-pt3cr) is a library that's as lightweight as Cheerio, but browser-compatible like JSDOM.

I've carved a repo for this out at https://github.com/stuartpb/dum

I'm thinking now: what if this is just a collection of translation methods for document trees without DOM interfaces?
