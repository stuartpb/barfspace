# PICO-8 Extremely Extended Memory Addresses

- A lot of the cool thoughts around [Casettic](d948aa6b-15a3-481e-a989-abae66d8ee9f.md) and [Dataturf](802e258f-9647-4d86-adfb-de2c9667f427.md) overlap with stuff you see in the Pico-8
- What if this was added as an extended method: PICONET, an addressing scheme that's a hybrid of save data and the BBS
- "The Tape Casnette"
- Maybe it's presented as an elaborate addressing series of PICO-8 numbers (like Drive/Cylinder/Sector/Head), and has performance implications accordingly
- OMG, just call it "XAN": the Extended Address Network

This could eventually have visualization layers like what I described in [Very Wide Mountable Address Space Memory Inspector](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md)

## realization

You could actually have an external daemon that watches for writes to the cartridge / save data, and uses another cartridge as a bus / fetch buffer for requests.
