# Linting and Rigging Markdown

- [ ] Integrate a Markdown linter to your workflow.
  - https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint
  - [ ] Create a bin for markdownlint, which it, for some reason, does not have.
    - Alternately, maybe these notes should have their own lint script behavior?
      - Seems unnecessary for me: the thing I really care about is just "don't commit stuff that won't render correctly", which is pretty straightforward.
      - This might make sense as an option to the constructor/bin, if it isn't already: "select all rules that will cause the page to not render as expected", versus "rules that are just fussy like which punct characters to use for emphasis"
  - [ ] Resolve https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/issues/144 to add broken-link detection.
    - Ideally, this would be superseded by "rig anything that isn't defined", but TBH, I don't feel like that is on the horizon right now
- [ ] Write bagtent-rig to make adding links easier.
  - [ ] Hook into bagtent-top-links.
  - [ ] Write up the menu that's probably specced on the bagtent plans page somewhere.
