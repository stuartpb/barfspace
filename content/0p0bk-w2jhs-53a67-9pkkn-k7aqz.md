# another thought on Bagtent IDs

(and this is maybe coming out of having seen Dynamicland a bit)

the ID of a doc could be its native coordinate in either a "canonical graph" (like, if you really want to commit to a spatial model of your data - which doesn't have to be a bad thing, just look at the PICO-8)

this goes straight through the other stuff I was writing the other day about putting spatial coordinates in frontmatter metadata for Red String Room
