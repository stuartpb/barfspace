# 3d Print Ideas by Filament

This is a list of things I want to make with the filaments I have

TODO: Make this a checklist, and I can list the things I *have* made with these filaments?

## Anything (Wipe Objects)

- Silicone sock molds

## Red PLA

- Spaceman Spiff ship

## Bronze PLA

Made my Lidded Ewer in this

## Realistic Gold PLA

- Pok&eacute;mon Gold cartridge for Pi Game Boy SD enclosure or whatever
- Infinity Gauntlet
- ModiBot Mo and Human Exo-stuff

## Silk Gold PLA

A lot of the same stuff as the Realistic Gold (ie. another Infinity Gauntlet).

I printed a temperature tower with this first, to get to know it

## Silver PLA

- (Prusa specifically) Pok&eacute;mon Silver cartridge
- More robot claw stuff

## Black PLA

- Vive bracket
- Hat rack weight holder

## Black Conductive ABS

- Abe case
- Touchscreen gauntlet / thimbles
- Touchscreen claw fingers / thimbles

## Black ABS

- Vive holders

## White ABS

- Vive holder intermediate stuff
- (with Sharpies) Various Lego stuff

## Glow-in-the-Dark PLA

- (or TPU, especially multi-material w/black backing layer) Fangs for putting Hook and Loop on, as a decoration of Stuzzy

## Translucent PLA

- LED Battery enclosures (ie. throwies)
- ~~Lampshades~~
  - Bad idea - you want temperature tolerance for this, even with LEDs
- Spaceman Spiff ship dome

## Translucent PETG

- [x] New fan shroud
  - NOTE: this melted - needs to be transparent ABS if anything
- [x] New control enclosure (in progress)

## Yellow PETG

- Ziploc bag "evidence"-style filing apparatus for bins

## Translucent Orange (or nice yellow in light) PETG

- [ ] Lampshade
- [ ] Final draft control enclosure etc

## Black and White PLA (Mixed Material)

- Double-Sided Stationary Local Time Zone Bullseye Clock
  - Local 12-hour time in middle
  - PM hours on outside (based on the more-numbers-with-double-digits-would-need-to-be-on-a-further-fourth-ring-for-local-24-hour-time logic)
  - Numbers gradually scale larger to signify am/pm?
  - Middle:
    - PST (UTC-0800)
    - From 9 1st Sun Nov
    - +PDT 9 2nd Sun Mar
    - US Since 2007
- Pro Cons and Law Rats chips

This idea was for my 24-hour microwave which I kept set to UTC - kind of dumb now, especially now that it's next to an oven with a 12-hour clock so I just leave the microwave unset
