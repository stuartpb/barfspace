# stustudio network numbering plan

branching off from thoughts [here](b9a55188-647f-4cd0-ab69-6df7e25ccb24.md)

I have a numbering plan for my internal network, and I've been keeping it proprietary, but, I mean, screw it, there's more to be learned from the best practices going into this

## related stuff I should write

TODO: build a "ranges to avoid" reference to cover stuff like "most routers pick these" or "some devices default to these" or "minikube uses this range"

also, an explainer of how these addresses work for people just getting into this stuff (ie. how IPv6 would completely make this a thing of the past) would be *dynamite*

## 192.168.0.0/25: DHCP reservations

- 192.168.0.23: studtop
- 192.168.0.37: studtop (wireless interface)
  - not in use, still reserved in case of emergency
- 192.168.0.33: stuflair
- 192.168.0.54: stuixel
  - my phone, its number ending in 0054
- 192.168.0.79: abe
  - Primer's runtime being 79 minutes
- 192.168.0.83: unnamed octopi
- 192.168.0.99: stuzzy
- 192.168.0.101: stushiba/stutendo
- 192.168.0.117: Misty II ("Misty Chief")

## 192.168.0.128-192.168.0.250: DHCP up-for-grabs dynamic pool

I'm using this, and not a different pool, because these IPs do have a way of working their way into configs ("soft reservations" and all), and I'd rather not have 192.168.6.0/24 be the "headers-that-arbitrarily-start-with-X" of those adoptions.

## 192.168.42.0/24: Stubernetes internal pool
