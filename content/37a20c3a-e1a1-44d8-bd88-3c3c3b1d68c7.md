# Friday Afternoon at Marshawnik University

Professor Max Delta "Lodge" Bannon on the phone with girl at records office

"What did you say your name is again? Jonah?"

"Uhh... Joannah?"

"Oh, dear, I'm terribly sorry. It's been a long day. My mind's still in Ancient Sumer."

He scrambles to play this off as normal, thinking he's said too much about the subject he studies; makes a weird comment about being in the office?

Anyway, he hangs up.
