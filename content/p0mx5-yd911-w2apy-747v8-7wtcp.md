# Trello Crew

Currently handling Lean Notes integration

previous jobs were migrating Projects (to Unusual Studio), Understanding Lua (to GitHub)

there are smaller Trellos to scavenge in the future

## To do

A thing specifying the ad-hoc transformation format of Trello into notes (the pattern mappings used, at least in Lean Notes)
