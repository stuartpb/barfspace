# Plushu Quests

## Refactor Plushu

[Plushu][]'s still a great system, but it's also still burdened by weird unnecessary assumptions about its environment that kind of melted on from being a lift from so much of Dokku.

- [ ] Split the Plushu core into multiple component parts.
  - Let "make a user that runs a command" be its own thing.
  - Make it so nothing in Plushu expects there
- [ ] Move all the existing Plushu plugins to their own project.
  - I think I was thinking of Plusku here? Like, the idea is that Plushu needs
- [ ] Remove all connections between plugin names and plugin behavior.
  - I think there's an issue for this somewhere around?

## Reviving the Sandbox

This is something I got sidetracked on about a year ago: I should get back to that.

https://github.com/plushu/sandbox.plushu.org/issues/2

- [ ] Make sure sandbox.plushu.org et al point to Packet.
- [ ] Set up a new watchdog for the sandbox.
  - [ ] Set up a timer.
  - [ ] Set up a service that runs outside the VM for the sandbox itself.
- [ ] Delete the Digital Ocean droplet for the old sandbox.
