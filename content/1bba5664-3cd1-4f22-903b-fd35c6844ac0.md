# Tabalanche notes

Now that [I'm using Firefox][viva], I'll need to revisit Tabalanche anyway

[viva]: 7b0f829a-7fbe-4896-9b5d-8196e1bca2a4.md

If there isn't a C9-style "Download workspace"... well, that's probably hackable with some other kind of GitPod port layer or something, but it'll make Pull Tool that much harder to work with.

Funny observation: with Tabalanche gone, I'm using these notes to stash tabs a lot more.

## Features that should be in the next Tabalanche revision

- Export as Markdown (per-stash)
- Search, obviously

## Things that should be overhauled

- Export should be streaming, just like import. YAML-based would probably be the best way to approach it.
- Do we have a better solution for persisting storage?
- Favicon cache is currently Chrome-specific: https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1315616 describes what'd be needed for a Firefox version
