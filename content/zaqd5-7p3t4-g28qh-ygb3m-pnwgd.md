# Wacky ideas for ways to "encode data"

[Steganography][] is something I think about a lot. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to top [Alphabinary Encoding](https://alpha.bi/), which, as far as I'm concerned, is a force of nature that I was merely able to unearth, but there are other isomorphic vectors for information transmsission that I think about when trying to convey the futility of small censorship.

Basically, I wish there was as much of a community around weird forms of steganography as there were around, like, chess

- Conjectural tournament brackets. Not only can you smuggle N-1 bits in a bracket of N teams (and potentially exponentially more if you start allowing for things like scoring conditions and ties), but if you accept any arrangement of teams against each other, you can encode potentially hundreds of shannons (my original math said nearly 400, but I think that's not accounting for certain classes of symmetry). There are probably enough football leagues across Europe to exchange an entire RSA key each season.

## a thought in this vein

I was thinking of a presentation that would start with something written on the slide, and I ask someone to read it, and I'm like "well, I suppose that's one way of looking at it", and then I reveal it's the bytes of a MIDI of the Close Encounters notes in Alphabinary or something
