# Solvents (Alcohol and Acetone) and Prints

Don't put acetone on your 3D prints except vapor for [smoothing](cefa5d2e-9936-49a9-9714-d57bcc903858.md). It turns PLA to dust, and it's not good for PETG either.

Either one is fine with isopropyl alcohol, though.

Only put alcohol on the textured print bed: either one's fine for smooth.
