    - maybe mention the camera
      - or maybe I can just mention it in the room, if the person's advanced enough
      - actually, heck, I can just spawn the damn camera - maybe mention they can ask (like "you can do it, or ask me to do it")

    - include keys thing as SVG
    - hotlink Twitter photo for keys
  - documentation on how to enable movement joystick on phones

    - probably a "jump to" link before the keyboard section, at least
    - remember I've already taken screenshots for this
      - I should take the relevant parts and put them in a folder for walking people through the process by holding up the screenshots and using the marker
  - explain webcam?
