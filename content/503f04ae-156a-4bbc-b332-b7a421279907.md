# Commented Code CI/One-Off Branch/Patch Model

A thing that checks if you're committing commented code, and if you are, it offers to remove the commented lines and introduce them as a branch (maybe with the option to not include some additions, for when the commented code was an alternative implementation)

this can be a nice kind of "learning to trust Git" helper
