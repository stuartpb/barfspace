# Bite Valve cover

I lost the mouthpiece and cap for my water pouch. I've got new mouthpieces, but I still need to come up with a good rigid piece to cover the bite valve when I'm not using it.

After some experimentation with geometry, my new plan is to have a "collar" around the mouthpiece (maybe even designed to fit best up near the top, so that can keep it oriented), and a cap with a retainer ring holding the rest of the neck to keep it in place (the cap would have lips at the top and bottom to fit over the collar)
