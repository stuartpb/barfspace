# Stuart and Tiare's Public Universal Friend

I create a Firefox Container

Already have stuartandtiare.com set to wildcard to both Tiare and me

Just made a new GitHub user, email is "puf@stuartandtiare.com"

## To integrate

This resembles the role of the "chip" user on my PocketC.H.I.P, and indeed, I'm planning on adding a stpuf keypair there, too
