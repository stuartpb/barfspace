## April 2019

- [Opinion: We Built A Broken Internet. Now We Need To Burn It To The Ground.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikemonteiro/we-built-a-broken-internet-now-we-need-to-burn-it) Basically a Thomas Friedman article about the need to replace Twitter with Mastodon. A white guy taking the observation everybody on Twitter has been making for years (the site sucks because it was made by white guys, for white guys) and tries to pass it off as his own bold call to action. No real suggestions for *how* we might do that, though. He's an *ideas* guy, you see.
- [I am not always very attached to being alive](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation), a great article about living with suicidal ideation
- [The Woman Who Rewrote Me](https://electricliterature.com/the-woman-who-tried-to-rewrite-me/) (note: article is about a deeply abusive relationship)
- [The Curse of the Diaeresis](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis), or, Why The New Yorker Will Never Stop Doing That Pretentious Thing With the Dots

## May 2019

- [A Conspiracy to Kill IE6](http://blog.chriszacharias.com/a-conspiracy-to-kill-ie6): How a few rogue YouTube engineers started a browser revolution. A pretty salient account of one of the Web's greatest tipping points in history.
- [About Face](https://popula.com/2019/02/24/about-face/), an illustrated reflection on the normalization of paramilitary/fascist iconography in American culture
- [Verge explainer on Avengers: Endgame](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537370/avengers-endgame-questions-answered-black-widow-tony-stark-captain-america-how-does-time-travel-work) - most notable for aggregating how much the movie's creators don't agree on some basic logical shit
- [Programming: doing it more vs. doing it better](https://kevinmartinjose.com/2019/04/08/programming-doing-it-more-vs-doing-it-better/) - an endorsement, then rebuttal, of the "do it more and get better at it" philosophy. Starts with a neat anecdote that's lifted directly from Jeff Atwood (with citation).
- [Minecraft Classic](https://classic.minecraft.net/) - okay, this isn't so much a "read" as it is a "visit for ten seconds", but I'm putting it here because meh, why not
- [Microsoft's looking to bring back PowerToys, this time on GitHub.](https://github.com/Microsoft/PowerToys) Huzzah.

## June 2019

- ['It's a miracle': Helsinki's radical solution to homelessness](https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jun/03/its-a-miracle-helsinkis-radical-solution-to-homelessness). Turns out, if you don't put a bunch of bullshit conditions on "deserving" homeless, you solve the problem. *Who could have guessed?*
- [The Surreal End of an American College](https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2019/06/what-its-like-when-your-college-shuts-down/591862/), for if you want to be miserable about collapsing institutions that served a social purpose. (There's maybe optimism about the opening this creates, ie. much cheaper online education, but that's also... a vulturous space of predation and cut corners. Gross "entrepreneur" land. Something to reflect on in [Notes to the Left](d601d7ba-522b-4d6d-9e3b-101885e7aa00.md).)
