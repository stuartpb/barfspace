# Markdown-first resume

This is an idea for [an overhaul of my resume system](bc3f5b92-6223-4fe0-9b4b-753190f4ace8.md), specifically from the standpoint of its first-clas data structure:

- I've been thinking that it'd be better to have my resume's native format be Markdown instead of YAML
  - new processor for converting resumes from a Markdown format (a la API Blueprint) to hResume
    - or, really, from semantic HTML to explicit hResume
      - which could then probably translate to JSON Resume et al
    - this could use something like [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype)
  - I'd need a component that can reliably break up names and addresses
    - or just hard-code the hResume spans for it

This might also make sense as part of an overall rework of my website to be statically-rendered (possibly on a schedule to keep the hair first-render up to date, via GitLab's cron CI features)

This overlaps the conceptual node for [Semantic Markdown](60205bb0-13ba-4730-a571-5b884a001314.md)
