## Previously

[Monetizing and Accounting](65aeb9ab-6e50-494b-87c2-82a1d6c122b2.md) was previous in the "linear flow" that just tried to weave the pages together (having Accounting in place does make it easier to reimburse your human workers).

## Overture

Not everything calls for a program. Some things just need that bedside manner and human touch: other things are just too tricky for even the current state of the art in neural networks to handle.

## Outsourcing Simple Tasks

(Protip/warning: recommending outside commercial service dependencies here. All the usual caveats and precautions apply.)

- Mechanical Turk
- CrowdFlower (is that even still a thing?)

## Moderators

See [Implementing User Accounts](c6891500-92fd-4774-9a14-d734d99bbdb4.md) for how to handle permissions from a technical perspective.

## Scaling Humans

(Not sure where I was going with this: maybe just that one should be conscious of how they're structuring their team? Maybe HR stuff?)
