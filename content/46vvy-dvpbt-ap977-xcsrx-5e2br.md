# Various mysterious legends and lost things

Welcome to the Bellarian Lost and Found.

## Lost books in the Bellarian tradition

- The hardboiled detective noir story of Bell's search for the missing messiah, *The Color of Plaid*
- An enlightening book on the importance of accepting religion to today's hard-working American business world, *The Pater Principle*

## Holy Artifacts

These are sacred treasures to the Bellarian faith, and SHOULD be investigated and searched for in a National-Treasure-esque escapade and eventually stolen.
