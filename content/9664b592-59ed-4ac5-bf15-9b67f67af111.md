- [work on something better than k3s](c10a9413-8615-4342-96ef-13dbc8cdb584.md)

essentially, the Packet thing can become my lab for a k3s / CoreOS replacement, as well as new-Plusku/printacle/Server Thing, and everything in between

this isn't *quite* Clusterhood? But it's... practice for what I'd want the Clusterhood to be like
