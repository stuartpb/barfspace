# Semantic Markdown

[This blog post from 2013](https://nikcodes.com/2013/08/20/semantic-markdown/) lays out the conceptual space neatly:

- Semantic Release Notes
- API Blueprint
- Fountain

## Related nodes in these notes

- [Tree/Thread Structure to Data Trees](12c94-bx3mm-45anr-8224g-k4mrs)
  - from the [Great Thread Jam Thread](5e1y8-03bex-6w9e6-7pq56-78ece)
- [Markdown loosely-structured document data model](g6k8m-cw8ed-47awn-3jp7d-k8vck)
  - Kind of like a spec for generic-Markdown-to-object semantics
- the new spec for the [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words](zpecy-dqpw1-wva8n-kf2kk-6kcr4)
- [bagtent index](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) has a lot more Markdown-adjacent content
  - especially the "Codebook"
- [Other specs-based-on-specs or whatever](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t)

## Other prior art?

"runbooks" for prometheus/kubernetes?

## Additional Markdown rules

"Semantic Markdown", as I see it, is about using *existing Markdown constructs for further semantic structure* (like API Blueprint) more than extending the syntactic constructs of Markdown itself - but, of course, as Markdown's syntax degrades gracefully, this line can be blurry

These are some notes (which could maybe be split to a separate page) on the custom Markdown rules the first half of the article talks about a bit, somewhat overlapping with my "Flavored Markdown" concept.

I like Markdown Extra's definition list syntax, and MultiMarkdown's citations.
