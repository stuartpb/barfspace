# Barfspace Implementation and Tooling Quests

This should be squared with [bagtent plans][] which is just sort of like a loose jot-down space of ideas I've had for bagtent stuff

whereas this is about tools that aren't necessarily bagtent things (like the Git autocommit shotclock, or CI), and a series of clear to-do lists

## Linting and Rigging Markdown

- [ ] Integrate a Markdown linter to your workflow.
  - https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint
  - [ ] Create a bin for markdownlint, which it, for some reason, does not have.
    - Alternately, maybe these notes should have their own lint script behavior?
      - Seems unnecessary for me: the thing I really care about is just "don't commit stuff that won't render correctly", which is pretty straightforward.
      - This might make sense as an option to the constructor/bin, if it isn't already: "select all rules that will cause the page to not render as expected", versus "rules that are just fussy like which punct characters to use for emphasis"
  - [ ] Resolve https://github.com/DavidAnson/markdownlint/issues/144 to add broken-link detection.
    - Ideally, this would be superseded by "rig anything that isn't defined", but TBH, I don't feel like that is on the horizon right now
- [ ] Write bagtent-rig to make adding links easier.
  - [ ] Hook into bagtent-top-links.
  - [ ] Write up the menu that's probably specced on the bagtent plans page somewhere.

## Linting the Prose

EDITOR'S NOTE: this should probably be thrown into some kind of new page for "out-there ideas for writing conventions"

- [ ] You know a tool I could really use? One that can detect when I've got a runon sentence left dangling.
  - https://textlint.github.io/ is prior art - it links out to some more in-depth stylistic proofreaders
  - It'd be funny if the thing that gets me to fully fall down on the side of punctuation for style, as I mused about in at least one Meta Collection post, would be that ending sentences with punctuation
  - [ ] Think about a format to denote "I can't write it all out right now but here's a few words that'll definitely fit in
    - [ ] See if this might make sense in some kind of context in the Alphabi-like encoder described below.
    - [ ] A linter that just catches... places where I've left these caret-jump-markers without a jog-your-memory bit (so, like, a grep invocation) would probably be enough to ease, like, 90% of the anxiety I have over incomplete commits
    - [ ] some way of auto-adding "I don't think you got where you're going" markers, or some analytics on my behavior when writing, might give some insight / help here
    - [ ] If this becomes a common convention it'd definitely become a thing we have to mention in the barfspace style guide / welcome wagon or whatever thing explains what all the weird local colloquialisms and jargon and whatever is. it'd also have to be like a hip trendy listening post registry bulletin about the latest slang, too? eh this is kind of into the weeds
  - Maybe if we ever introduce YAML frontmatter, opting into various prose checks can be one of its primary functions?

## Bagtent Publisher

This is a specific tool aimed at making website building as easy as buying a pack of Post-It notes and a marker.

That last line is a great vision statement, especially attainable if you attach something like the IPFS quests after this one so that providing hosting doesn't have to be a single party's concern.

It overlaps a bit with the goals and philosophy of penciltape, and might make sense as a layer / paradigm around its use (like, the default layout has a "content" directory, and there's a button to create a new page by UUID, and penciltape can have use for all these other UI affordances, like maybe there's a way to make filenames second-class relative to the first line and subsequent content, like how GMail presents email subjects / bodies).

- [ ] Build something that will let people just start publishing markdown to a URL as a website, without having to give pages names or anything, and just relying on web UI affordances to the same ends as the Bagtent scripts (ie. search, maybe some kind of keystroke / menu option for "Spawn...")
  - [ ] Is there a layer we can drop on top of GitHub Pages?
    - [ ] I've been thinking there are a couple other projects I could accomplish with an overlay over a common codebase for this, like hubstrap
    - [ ] "Local buffers that autocommit under certain JS condition tests and then immediately push" would be a cool Wayside configuration that could effectively work like this
      - [ ] and if I write all the bagtent CLI in Node, which I probably won't do, I could run this in the browser
      - [ ] Well, a mix of JS and shell scripts might work
        - what's that JS-based Bash clone thing that one guy made who made Vorpal or whatever, I wanna say Cash?
  - [ ] Would this make sense for NeoCities?
- [ ] Hell, even just a Markdown editor with a bookmarks pad (I know I wrote this one somewhere) and a preview mode that can edit after following a link would be gangbusters
  - [ ] I mean, hell, even just an editor with a parser that lets me, say, ctrl+click a linked word in Markdown to parse and follow the link
  - it's a shame that the blocking element from just building this on the web platform would have to be the Git angle
  - working out even a basic interface to that with something like just a local thing to dispatch Git commands in a container... wouldn't work on chromebooks unless they support container platform, so that's out
  - [ ] do up a Lean Notes page about the state of doing Git stuff in JS

Also noting here that there're a few ideas on the Projects page for bagtent frontends that touch this

## An IPFS Publishing Cloud

- [ ] Is there a Neocities-like app for pushing content straight to the cloud?
- [ ] This would make sense as a service for Clusterhood users. Progress on the Clusterhood arc to lay groundwork for a production implementation of this idea.
- [ ] Would there be a more sensible way to structure Barfspace for IPFS? Like maybe instead of UUIDs under content it's just a bunch of IPNS names?
  - [ ] Does IPNS scale like that? (Quest-meta-question: is it cool to just list questions as checkboxes? I feel like an answer needs more than a "check", but I guess that's the job of adding further list items that aren't checks?)
    - On that meta-question, I think peppering in non-quest-items as list items was supposed to be an integral part of how quest progression was supposed to be denoted, at one late-in-bed furious-braincrevice-digging thing or otherwise buried thought process that I'm starting to recover, how list items can be used to give periodic updates on progress
- [ ] Your questions on this arc are going to be kind of dumb until you've Learned More.
  - [ ] Get back into the swing of collecting Lean-Notes-styled notes for my understanding of a technology, procedure, etc.
  - [ ] Integrate some of that stuff into the Lean Notes tree in appropriate places. (ED: this branch is veering into Operations-quest territory)
- [ ] Add a feature to the shotclock script that lets it hold off on running the shotclock when a test command fails.

## Barfspace Tools and CI

Remember back when Barfspace auto-committed, and how you've stopped running it in the migration to bagtent because you don't want the repository committing with unreachable posts? Let's fix that.

- [ ] Progress on the "Developing Your Bagtent Tools" quest to unlock solutions to tasks here.
- [x] Write the bagtent-orphans script.
  - You used the bagtent-orphans script to make sure you weren't forgetting any files you'd created before making a commit. Nice job!
- [ ] Make a new version of the shot clock that has a key you can press to conjure a new file, which will have its name printed on the command line, and be added to the commit and all
- [ ] In conjunction with the feature above, have the shot clock pause when it finds a file is orphaned, and only rechecks, like, every seven seconds?
  - [ ] or only manually seems fine to me - probably easier to code, too
  - [ ] Should still have a way to invoke conjure while there are orphans, if you need it
  - [ ] Reminder that the conjure button should both echo the name AND pop open an editor tab, following a given command / alias you're expected to have in place and defaulting to `c9 open` or something like that? Is there already a version of `$EDITOR` that means "nonblocking invocation to open a new buffer"?
- [ ] What about the command to open a file by toplink name? Or just a "run a grep on all content files" key.
- [ ] Have a way, if there isn't one, to limit the shot clock's watch scope to just content files.
- [ ] Write a new git-slum-like script that just describes changes in terms of total bytes across files.
- [ ] Hell, just a Markdown editor with a preview pane that lets you open other files by link would be hugely helpful (EDITOR'S NOTE: wrong list)
- [ ] Figure out how to make commit messages that are just like "597+685=1282 changed bytes" (removals + additions)
