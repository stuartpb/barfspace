# Extreme Open Notes

This is an umbrella for the [Method Lab](k8m91-rn0z9-449r7-hwfhz-c9wma) to generalizing thoughts from notes on [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) and the [Academy of Barfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j) (the kind of thought that originally led into [Lean Notes](y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm) and some of my other note iterations) into a more general pitch.

I'm thinking now that "Lean Notes" can become the umbrella term for the whole bagtent / Extreme Open Notes philosophy, where everything is just filed randomly by die rolls or whatever, and pointed to by link, and maybe you paginate them in separate physical places or whatever, or partition or redistribute or whatever, but so long as you follow a consistent random-numbering philosophy (bagtent is best for this in electronic form) and allow everything to be Choose Your Own Adventure like that, you'll not have to stress out about how to keep track of what notebook that would have been in or whatever

you could maybe also use a 20-sided die numbered 00 to 19 and roll it a number of times to get an ID, or something like that (the 00-19 thing is recommended for even digit distribution and parity/check digits)

UPDATE: this evolved into the [UUID Dice][] idea
