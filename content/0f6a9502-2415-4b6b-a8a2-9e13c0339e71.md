# Lockheart

Prototyping this in transparent PLA. In theory, that would let me see the mechanism, but in practice it modtly just means slightly better lighting

The first issue I had, and this happened the last time I was getting ready to tackle this, was that the bottom layer was fused together. I'd tried addressing this with lowered temperatures, but that only lowered reliability: I ended up solving this with 0.4mm of Elephant Foot Compensation in PrusaSlicer.
