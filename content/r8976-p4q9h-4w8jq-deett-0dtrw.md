# Understanding Support Material

You need support material not just for overhangs: you also need it because, as is covered in
[Understanding the First Layer](jbpz7-52jek-mc9e9-zvawp-yh7c0), the nozzle *pushes* plastic onto on your model (at small scale), and if the part it's pushing on isn't well supported, this can cause the whole thing to pop off. (Try printing a marble without enough support: you'll see the piece pop off somewhere around the halfway point, and you'll probably see only part of your brim/whatever come off first).
