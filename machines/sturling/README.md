# sturling

sturling is the name that has been passed down since my first experiments with Arch Linux (hence the name alluding to Sterling Archer). It is a system based on removable storage, that I take from system to system as available.

This iteration is based on the 32 GB M.2 storage chip I pulled out of my first Chromebook, then bootstrapped from stuzzy.
