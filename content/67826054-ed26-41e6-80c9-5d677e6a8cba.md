# manifest of state of my first-round Notes workspace

This setup died with the rest of [Studtop Mark I](9af1ee19-ac0a-46e1-8a9c-d6815a455f4f.md) in the process of enacting the [June 5 2020 Sprint](0797b86d-85be-439b-8b5f-c5477026a8b8.md)

 is being remade as [Notespace on Stubernetes Mark II](77124417-31d7-4b6b-85b2-352e8c7984f2.md)

## Notable logs from studtop mk 1 on this workspace in particular

- Arc of Creation
  - [One Last Step](54250980-bf8c-43a7-a028-d838467bbb33.md)
- [Day 2](1558a75c-b543-452d-a119-d584595479ab.md)
- ran into a problem where the files in the PVC stopped working.
  - this was probably foreshadowing the problems that necessitated the June 5 procedure
  - wanting to know how we got here is why I want to install Loki as soon as Prometheus in Mk 2
