# Notes on Understanding Lua's art style

See notes [on userdata](bdd4136f-7ac0-4162-9e3f-d92c396758ed.md) for how art style can be used to distinguish non-diegetic elements and/or userdata.

Also, "sketch" style is what I'm thinking can illustrate a function being *defined* (and/or the function as a value), as described in the notes [On Functions](f5af227c-b543-4601-8cf6-598c7362df92.md).
