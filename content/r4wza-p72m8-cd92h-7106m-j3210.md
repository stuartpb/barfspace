# Remaining Writing in Foreign Repos

This is an early draft of the [June Judgment](pyw3b-her8e-48awm-xxhbq-kdngd) that is currently decomposing. Once everything's reconciled, this page can become a postmortem on why these notes have formed a better incubator than loose GitHub repos (and how trauma had kept me from pursuing it for years).

- [ ] stuartpb-loadout
  - [ ] Maybe have a note page describing how I generally roll these days, loadout-wise.
- [ ] Manual of Style
  - This was, itself, just an offshoot from
- [ ] github-mistakes
- [ ] The SACRED Properties should probably get explored more in these notes before I try to spin a whole website out for them.
- [ ] The Plates of GATEs thing should probably get some kind of page in these notes, and probably be un-repoified... unless the template is in there already, in which case, eh whatever.
- [ ] What even *is* stuart-explains?
- [ ] date-rosetta can probably continue to live as a repo but will need a notes page (the Projacronym/Concept-Lab page alludes to a "Shadow notes" nexus at some point, that'd be where those notes would fork from)
- [ ] help-wanted should be absorbed into the notes
