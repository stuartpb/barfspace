# The convergence of The Reformation Over My Old Bad Ideas

Okay, this is a core idea that I've been dancing around for years:

**Humans really don't need all that much structure.** Like, really, this is why the "semantic tags that don't really do anything" in HTML et al fell by the wayside, and the "tags that do something but don't have semantic meaning" have been so irritatingly unkillable.

But this is why you can "[just put this here][]" and get great success, but if you spend a long time planning an elaborate community, you'll get a ghost town.

Like, the more you say "you need to understand this whole new world to participate in it", the less likely people are to *start participating* in it. "Catch as catch can" is the only way to get people involved that I've ever seen actually work: the trick is to make "catching" antifragile - think Twitter, where people are constantly making jokes about the site and its format. I thought this was dumb and narcissistic at first (you know, back in 2008 or whatever), but then I realized that *this is how the community coalesces* - nobody ever says "this is how you use Twitter", they do *observational comedy* about how people *are using* Twitter, and the audience reads between the lines to figure it out for themselves.
