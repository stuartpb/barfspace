# on conjuring without having a page in mind

## examples from these notes

[this one](2b83e400-6b77-44bc-9718-f6b94c74396e.md) had just a parenthetical "put this somewhere in the meta indices"

## on CI

you could make the publish branch enforce one-way reachability - or, gosh, even two-way (though I certainly don't write my notes like that)

## tooling

you can solve this so easily with just "take the result of `bin/validate`" (or whatever simpler bagtent-orphans tooling-or-port would be appropriate here, to get the list of orphans), and then "drop them in a file" and "link that file from whatever page you're counting as the center of your universe"

you could also maybe have some kind of natural tree creation, though?

that'd be a neat Bagtent tooling feature: Automatic Table of Contents by way of capturing subsets of

maybe that'd be (I think I trailed off and started looking into Notebook Systems)

## wormhole starts here

(move this to another page)

[Docco](ee5a893a-e4c8-45bb-aa93-3c68c8cc6378.md), that's the one I was thinking of

https://rtomayko.github.io/shocco/ seems interesting too

## Dang, I think I got lost here

But yeah, wasn't I making sooe notes on Literate Programming, or Literate PICO-8? And how fenced blocks ought to have directives for append/prepend, as well as language?

And how that starts to intersect with a Notebook system, I think I never got around to drawing the aconnection - but I started looking for a system that presents its content in some kind of previewable window

## finding

this is definitely a bit in the Big May 20 Blob

anyway, I just searched for "Literate" and this appears to be the first mention of it in these notes: So here are some more literate programming notes

https://github.com/vijithassar/lit - a shell-script-based-simple preprocessor that just comments out all the lines that aren't code blocks

the thing about preprocs like that is that they can't present the code in *literate order*. I was reading somewhere about how that's a core part of the Knuth model, being able to group parts of code from different places into the text
