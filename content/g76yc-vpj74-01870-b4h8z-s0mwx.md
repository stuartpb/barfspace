# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few emergent pathways.

## The Journals

This has currently become the biggest lens into my notes: documenting progress on projects and personal stuff

- [Journals](wfnke-ray7p-05acs-htzh0-5d9cv)
  - [Lean Notes](y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm)
    - the Hugo to Journals' Bart
    - specifically overlaps with the Research sub-branch

## Noteball Administratum

The [Noteball Adminstratum](jc2sg-8t107-wwavv-6pftm-fgz08) contains notes regarding these notes themselves. Commonly-accessed branches:

- the [Oozy Sewer](6yanh-hg3gd-s69sp-wyba4-qgkgt) is a project specifically about studying emergent behaviors
- the [Notestack Core of Engineers](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) handles all non-content-based planning for the notes' implementation
  - the [bagtent index](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3) managed there

## Check-Ins and Jam Sessions

- [Jam about Threads](5e1y8-03bex-6w9e6-7pq56-78ece)
- [Check-in stuff](thhqg-6e2m7-g8atd-et5wm-a5bg5)

## Other branches

- [Link Stashes](1wcbn-7ywby-rtabp-jgt2e-e7tek)
- [Tastes and Takes](csgwv-469mv-wt9fk-1yphz-svvje) (Reviews and Reactions)
- [Pitches and Scripts](pabtd-y2p8v-819qr-eqxng-5d98k)
- Current thought aggregate: [The Spirit World in the Machine](gncbq-65szw-c490v-zyxrb-k27tb)
- [Overlooked Gems](6k2bq-mgkc9-0c87z-0rqr7-gqgs3)
- [Hot Topics](3zrzq-gyfy9-4daq9-dg7v9-gq8w1)
- [Just Some Other Parts of Me](we198-w4xt7-8dacs-mwjda-1hggy)
- [Pure and Utter Posting](ypm0w-a35wx-00atk-m2r7q-gy109)

## Etcetera

[Taverns and Commissaries](tk9fv-fjcxb-g0amm-wgchp-ktmw6) gathers the long tails of any content in these notes that doesn't fit somewhere above (yet)
