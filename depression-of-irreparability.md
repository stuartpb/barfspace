One of the biggest contributors to depression for me, and a big motivator for the priorities of the properties outlined in [SACRED][], is when something I own and depend on begins exhibiting defective behavior, and there's nothing I can do to fix or work around it, because the processes contributing to the defect are too opaque to understand.

This problem of opaque and irreperable defectiveness isn't unique to me, and I'm pretty sure the depression isn't, either. One of the gross things about capitalism is how the people who contribute to this opaque culture generally resolve the problem: by using their garish means to simply purchase a wholesale replacement (a purchase out-of-reach for the lower classes, who are expected to make do, through a building tsunami of [Vimes' boots][] that compounds upon itself).

The interplay between this and the concept of evergreen browsers is interesting, because outdated browsers are a common feature of "obsolete" equipment, but they're no more simple. The core of this comes down to *simplicity* (or Straightforwardness, as it's named in SACRED): we build problems when we make machines *too complex to understand*, which then become too complex to repair.

Like, I have a problem with buggy open-source software, but when I can see and understand the *nature* of the bug, my problem is *nothing like* the problem I have with proprietary technology. To take the understanding of the issue out of my hands is to... I just checked, and I thought "understanding what's going on" was part of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs][], but I guess it isn't. Nonetheless, there's a distinct notion of agency that I can't remember off the top of my head right now that talks about how not having a solid cause-and-effect basis for reality as it's experienced is a major contributor to stress.
