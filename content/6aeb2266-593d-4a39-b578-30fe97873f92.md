[Professional Helmbags](ae0f6969-d62b-495f-bdd5-028b2205a255.md) for developers.

## Development suite

- GitLab
- GitPod or some other integrable Theia provisioner
- a [local/internal registry](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/installation/private-registry/)
- Any other supplemental CI
  - these [Helm deployment systems](https://kubedex.com/helm-deployments/) might apply
  - Maybe some kind of app that automatically sets up your GitLab configuration to push a buildpack and all the end-to-end stuff?

overlap with Wayside et al

Also overlaps with whatever Helmbag ends up suggesting JupyterHub (also, what about Coral?)
