# installing the base package

[base is a package now](https://www.archlinux.org/news/base-group-replaced-by-mandatory-base-package-manual-intervention-required/), you did a `yay -S base`

also, OpenSCAD had a release in May, so I can use that instead of my Git build now: did `yay openscad` to get that replacement going
