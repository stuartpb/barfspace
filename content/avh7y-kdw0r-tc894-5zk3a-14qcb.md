# Ooh, can this be another pattern to support: Scratchpad Notes?

Like, I just write the sections and not really care what page they go on, and then I'll drag them into place on their own pages later

I can even use the Scratchpad as a Loose Notes or similar construct, and instead of "tearing off the loose roll" I "tack another length onto the roll"

It's interesting how this inversion came *after* it was no longer a pain in the ass to conjure and insert pages (thanks not only to `bagtent-conjure --open`, but also `bin/validate` to allow me to conjure new files without worrying about them getting lost among new files I *had* hooked up)

also, this reflects how the big problem with my current editing model has become an overabundance of open tabs - keeping everything to one document helps me create-and-close a little more effectively

also, having everything in one file like this makes it easier to find a thought within it via ctrl+f. this is a problem that a proper search implementation (at least UI-wise) would ameliorate. maybe I should get more comfortable with Code's searcher?

or, really, my Kubernetes cluster is getting close to ready, I'll just Theia it

I can have Scratchpads be a different editing pane or whatever in the Theoretical Workspace, just like the Table of Contents

The thing is that the Table of Contents / Sidebar needs to navigate to files in the *navigation* pane

Also probably in Code?

Hey, have I envisioned a version of this where it works like Norton Commander?
