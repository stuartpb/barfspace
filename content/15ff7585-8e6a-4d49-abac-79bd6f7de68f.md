# Is there a Delegation Mechanism for ACME?

I think I wanted to see about this because I wanted to be able to point a name I don't want to reconfigure stuff on Cloudflare or whattever to say "point these DNS records" like a CNAME so I don't have to dynamically set the ACME responses on the DNS server that is a pain to adjust
