# The Top-Level README Committee

I *think* these are all present? There should probably be a page that can link off from the Root Note talking about the design of the README / landing page

- You are not expected to understand these, they are primarily just public to make it so it's as hard for me to lose my notes as possible
- That you might be able to read them is a useful benefit that I may inconsistently cater to at times
- When I'm trying to make them accessible, it's as much about making it so I don't forget myself when I come back and try to read them later, if not more, than about making them accessible to others
- They're like code comments like that
- These are a constantly-updating set of documents, unless stated otherwise
- Feel free to get your own ideas from these notes, but don't go attributing anything more than the words to me
- At the end: "With all these disclaimers out of the way, Click here to proceed to the current root note."
