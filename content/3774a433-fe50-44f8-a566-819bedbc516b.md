# Filament Extrusion Plans and Status

## One Less Resistor in the Circuit

You've been paying Amazon retailers for filament of unknown provenance for too long. Pretty soon, you'll have paid the entire cost of what one of these machines would have cost to buy (if you haven't already): for that, you probably could have extruded it yourself for a third of the cost. (It'd probably be for the best to not try doing the math on that until you can safely put those days behind you.)

Completing this quest will unlock Fully Reliably Reproducable Print Recipes, where the entire construction of a print, from chemical form to extrusion, is fully documented, and can be altered independently.

It will also unlock full material and color control, including reuse of recycled material as a component.

It will also unlock significantly cheaper filament on demand.
