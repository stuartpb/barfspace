# a new idea for the flow

based on some ideas that fell out from [2020-04-16 draft](z79at-q9vsa-m9aq1-t9eh7-vk6cz) that I liked:

"What's so bad about capitalism?" is a difficult answer to explain to most Americans, because capitalism is all we've ever known. It's like trying to explain vegetarianism to someone who's never seen any other kind of food. To them, "vegetable" is just the singular word for "food": you show them a strawberry, a wheel of cheese, and a steak, and they'd say "oh, I've never seen these vegetables before".

So before we answer "What's so wrong with capitalism", we have to answer the simpler question: "What's capitalism?" And that's one that nobody can seem to give a straight answer to. Once you've realized the enormity of it all, it's not hard to understand why: if someone asks you to explain the atomic bimb, you don't start with a primer on nuclear physics.
