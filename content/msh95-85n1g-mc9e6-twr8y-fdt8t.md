# getting my cluster configuration into Git

just created https://github.com/stuartpb/stubernetes-setup

probably gonna roll my config .d script into the global config; there's no real modularity to be gained from keeping things separate here.

## updates from later

okay yeah I did this

I still have separate files under `manifests`

might also make a `resources`
