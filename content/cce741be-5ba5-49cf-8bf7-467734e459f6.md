# Thoughts on describing immutability

Comments from my Trello card on this (which had been labeled "Too early?"), which were then moved to GitHub Issue #3:

---

If you've done lower-level programming, you can apply/refer to your knowledge of references and pointers.

This works again for the same weird reason it works in comics. We can see the same character in multiple places in a panel, and we get that that's fine without needing someone to tell us there's a cloning machine or something.

It's still sort of hard to get without visual cues. In comics it usually represents time flow and often motion lines. OR, if it's superposition, it's thought balloons. An aside may be needed to fully explain the idea that a "value" exists in several places at the same time. It's like, Mickey may be in five parts of the park, but there's still only one Mickey Mouse, yeah?

This concept doesn't really become an issue until you get to the mutable idea of tables (or functions that come from different scopes), and the idea of assigning them to multiple locations, so it's possible this concept can be held off until then.
