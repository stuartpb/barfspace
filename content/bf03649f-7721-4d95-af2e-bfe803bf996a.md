# Bagtent navigation stub

This page is here to try to define the contours of what represented an idea that would make it to the "Bagtent Navigation" cluster to me.

That might lead to the bit on [the page this page's content moved to](b7c9b553-a923-41aa-9772-de2056570656.md) splitting off to join another cluster of pages that more clearly defines the space, Bigger-Katamari style.

Anyway, it's about the nature of exploring a flat, interlinked space in a way that presents the links beyond just the page you're looking at.
