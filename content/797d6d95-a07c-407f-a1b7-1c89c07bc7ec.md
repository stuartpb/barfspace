# Trivia ideas

idea for greater outside page: The Principles of Trivia (ie. what makes a "Zippo" question, what skills you're testing for - compare GWD trivia to Sporcle Live, etc)

## Round themes

- was granted top-secret nuclear clearance after detecting fallout on their stock
- had their own enriched-uranium reactor
