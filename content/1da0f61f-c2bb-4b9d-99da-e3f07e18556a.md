# The Current Report of Broken Notes

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the current nexus for my base of operations under the [Department of Development][DoD]. Update your bookmarks.

2019-05-07: Making a note here that I should revisit the Project Akira Great Notes Consolidation page to reflect on its thoughts as they pertain to how the issues I was writing about then have evolved and are evolving.

a couple days later: ALSO, [petlogs should get merged into these notes][petloggins]

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]

Most of the stuff on this page that was still relevant has been packed up and moved to [Barfspace Operations][] - it's currently just become a historical landmark as "The Triage Site", where it was used to refer to the kind of legacy work Operations was meant to cover (it should really be renamed "Ongoing Legacy Quests")
