# reading documentation progress

massive shoutout to Kelsey Hightower for giving me the giant insight "containers within pods all run on the same host, like when you need a sidecar" that is really the thing I needed to start understanding this -- that plus the Concepts overview make up pretty much the bedrock of my engagement with all this

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/

okay, my head is spinning, but https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/ is a *really* good introduction that is, like, exactly what I need, that isn't condescending "What are containers? What's a computer?" but actually telling exactly what I actually want to know, really :100: stuff
