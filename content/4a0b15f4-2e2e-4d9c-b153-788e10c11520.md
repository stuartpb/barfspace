`/etc/sysconfig/network/dhcp` looks good enough per [2020-08-10 Kluster Rollout](3b3be951-82c4-4e31-845f-5d1579a4302b.md)

but it doesn't appear to make it do what I want

trying setting `add_local_fqdn` to `3` on the router per https://openwrt.org/docs/guide-user/base-system/dhcp

oh wait that's for publicizing the router's address - found further documentation to that effect

## a pivot on the DHCP strategy

So, I wasn't able to get the static DHCP leases to set the fully-qualified hostname on stumethyst, no matter how much experimentation I did.

However, the more I think about it, the more I realize the way I'd been approaching DHCP had been founded on a router that doesn't have proper DNS resolution based on DHCP leases from received hostname.

I still think it's cool to have nodes use pre-assigned boutique IP addresses (at least for now), but I'm going to approach this a sensible way: I'll flash hostnames for each device's image, then have the router hand out static lease assignment based on recognition of those hostnames, rather than try to assign names externally via MAC address (which was too hardware/interface specific, anyway: I want these IP assignments to move with the hostname, not the hardware).

As such, I go ahead and unset the MAC fields in these DHCP reservations, and rearchitect the numbering plan so our static leases now look like this:

- stumethyst.kluster.testtrack4.com: 192.168.86.23
- stuby.kluster.testtrack4.com: 192.168.86.25
- stuphire.kluster.testtrack4.com: 192.168.86.27
- sturl.kluster.testtrack4.com: 192.168.86.29

Actually... it looks like the unbound/odhcpcd combination I'm using doesn't resolve names except for the couple hosts I have that expose just flat hostnames

looking at /usr/lib/unbound/odhcpd.awk to understand

## update later

I've filed a pull request upstream: https://github.com/openwrt/packages/pull/13096

I'll need to write up what I've summarized
