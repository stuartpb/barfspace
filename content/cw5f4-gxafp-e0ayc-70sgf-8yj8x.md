# Gitolite notes and links

[Gitolite](https://gitolite.com/gitolite/overview.html) is freaking ancient and I'm amazed it's still around

- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/install.html
  - https://gitolite.com/gitolite/quick_install.html
- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/wild
  - the "owners" concept is sorely underdocumented?
- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/rc.html
- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/http.html
- https://gitolite.com/gitolite/non-core
