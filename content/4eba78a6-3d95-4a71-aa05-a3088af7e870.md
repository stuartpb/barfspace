# Notes News Update 2019-03-08

So, I'm thinking of moving this repo over to GitLab Pages, and writing my own rendering system.

One thing I'm thinking it'd be cool to add, if I could have my own system for this - so, one of the major perks of doing this would be that I'd get to do my own pug-based template renderer or whatever.

But another thing I'm thinking could be fun would be an "add these stylesheets for these pages" spec, like "everything linked from one of the two Lean Notes pages shoyld have this Lean Notes stylesheet". Kind of like the special rules around creating trees for notes that live somewhere around the plans for Bell TPC in the Unconvincing Truth notes.

ADDENDUM 2019-05-03: A custom rendering system would also be able to point to "This page was deleted, see the commit that deleted it for directions toward where you should probably go", that would make it so I wouldn't have to leave so many stubs and stumps around

Ooh, maybe there can be an on-demand renderer that renders the tree at a certain point by refspec? hmm, idk if there's a suitable reflog upstream, like, how would it handle pages merged in from foreign trees that had a different version of the page... i don't know, it's weird, it's bridges I'd cross when I came to them
