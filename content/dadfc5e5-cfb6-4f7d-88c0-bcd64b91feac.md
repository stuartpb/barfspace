# Project Akira

This note has become the semantic nexus for recording the point in history where the scope of this repository started to explode.

The early stages are described at [how-i-roll's Tomb][]. From there, it expanded to an issue in Lean Notes, and that led to some thinking here.

[how-i-roll's Tomb]: bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md

Eventually, it became clear that most of my writing was going to get collected into this repository: how to structure this incoming work spontaneously developed as a one-off thought on [My Old Bad Ideas][], then was eventually brought to this page.

[My Old Bad Ideas]: f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md

The gist of that content was later wplit off to its own page, which has developed into [Operation Trapper Keeper][OTK], the continuation of the work described here.

[OTK]: 1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md

There were some quests that were here at one point which have since been migrated over to [Various Operations][bops] under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB].

[bops]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

The rest of this page tends to be kind of half-relevant: trying to deconstruct it so that this page can serve a clean historical function is part of Operation Trapper Keeper.

I think this page is such a mess because I forgot where I got this idea to merge in Lean Notes to barfspace originally? It was when I realized that I wanted the revamped bagtent-based barfspace to have Linkdumps, then I realized that that's a lot of what the function of Lean Notes was, and that started the gears turning

Anyway, the way that this didn't have that clear "origin" at the top is I think a big part of why I kept, like churning on "here's a related project", because I vaguely recalled formulating it, but couldn't remember where.

It was in [Barfspace Vision Quests][BVQ], and I guess I was only looking in Operations, because I forgot what a mess BVQ was?

ADHD sucks like this, y'all!!

## A little thing about Quests vs. News vs. Right Now

So the thing is that News was, and/or is, meant to be like "snapshots of my life right now" - highlighting the cross-section of all my projects... Right Now was originally supposed to be a rotating overview of what's on my plate at the moment, but it's becoming obvious that it'd work a lot better as an index for something like a constant State of the Union for all my projects, with the index being the concise snapshot, maybe.

Anyway, there's also a matter of General Notes for Projects, and Quests (which often don't slice evenly to projects) to boot.

So I'm thinking what might make sense would be to merge Right Now with Project Ideas, Project Ideas maybe turning into a page or two like "Just Idle Thoughts and Planning" -

oh snap, Right Now is just Stage 1 and 2, where Ideas was Stages 0 and 1, in Unusual Studio terms. So maybe that's the solution?

Nah, I think what it is is... I should have a Projects index with just, you know, everything as a big list with "all the pages for each project, if there's no dedicated index page for it", something like that, where they're really pretty much just in order of how hairy the notes situation is?

No, wait, they can be organized in terms of stage (and then hairiness, maybe, IDK). Anyway, Right Now would then be a recency-list index

One axis I feel like I kind of need to slice along is "projects that are inherently personal" (ie. "fix the left joycon to stop drifting on my Switch" versus, like, NilPass), and I think that was the original intention behind Right Now, to reflect my personal priorities in a way that a Projects list couldn't. Right Now was meant for the personal - but not *too* personal? because that's what News was kind of about.

Okay, so, that's kind of served by Quests, really. My "current personal state" is best reflected as a recap of what's to be done, personally.

So maybe Right Now... yeah I think Right Now just needs to become, like, Quest Tracker, with the Quests page being the overview tree of all Quests.

and I mean that does reflect its origins as a Planfile

and then Project Ideas can become the "random aimless musings" connector to that, where what we're currently calling "News" becomes "where I put random aimless musings when they're not clearly attached to a project".

## An excised musing about organic growth and the nature of thinking versus creation

There was a task in "Dividing Up the New World" in the [Barfspace Operations][] for "Write somewhere (in the neighborhood of [metaquiddity][] or [the meta collection][]) about how it's totally natural for more layers of indirection to organically emerge like this"

There was a subtask beneath that: Shout out to the tree down by the "Everything I Know" or whatever quest in the [Mindfulness Arc][], which is doing this same sort of layer-forming

The rest were listed as checkbox items beneath that:

Like, ultimately, this is part of my overall intent with the Meta Collection to capture my meditations on writing in this repo, and how they echo out in the world around me

Should loop in that one XKCD somewhere around here about [an entire system just existing to maintain itself][xkcd 1579], because I know that's definitely a mania thing I take care to avoid

another xkcd that captures what it's like to have truly unbridled organic development: [xkcd 1360][]

### more from another pulled quest blip

There's also the thing about how this is all kind of like a rough draft and how, with programming / creative projects, notes like this as a to-do list, if you return to them a ton, so long as you're only focusing on things you currently can do and sub-dividing what you can currently do, you can eventually get to a point where you've effectively accomplished your entire task in the form of specifying out its entire structure (or that a bunch of the chains will collapse into completion after a very small number of nontrivial tasks complete and all the effectively-Promise.all()-like-waits close with the parent checks getting checked off by their lists being completed)

Another meta idea I'm gonna drop right here right now: how, like, all this fanciness I'm doing for hashes is only really necessary for humans under the assumption that we need an adversarial model for authoritative / canonical names like IPNS, and how just searching for a thing and picking the most popular result, like, no kidding Google legitimately changed the world, and now just googling eight words from a John Mulaney act is enough to find you the full transcript within five seconds

Update: that seems kind of related to The Quests in the Quotes from the [Barfspace Vision Arc][BVA], but from the other side

## Notes for the top-level README

I *think* these are all present? There should probably be a page that can link off from the Root Note talking about the design of the README / landing page

- You are not expected to understand these, they are primarily just public to make it so it's as hard for me to lose my notes as possible
- That you might be able to read them is a useful benefit that I may inconsistently cater to at times
- When I'm trying to make them accessible, it's as much about making it so I don't forget myself when I come back and try to read them later, if not more, than about making them accessible to others
- They're like code comments like that
- These are a constantly-updating set of documents, unless stated otherwise
- Feel free to get your own ideas from these notes, but don't go attributing anything more than the words to me
- At the end: "With all these disclaimers out of the way, Click here to proceed to the current root note."

## Thoughts on the Greater Barfspace

This is a quest-to-create-quests that's been grafted off of the Barfspace Operations stuff: it should be turned into the corresponding quest entries it describes for Barfspace Vision an Network Neighborhood.

I guess if this becomes notes.stuartpb.com, then you'd just call the general conceptual space of zero-filter self-oriented incidental-publishing (ie. using any platform in this fashion, not just bagtent, which can be used in other fashions) "Open Notes", like "the Open Notes movement"

- or maybe we'll call it XON, pronounced like "Exxon", for "*eXtreme* Open Notes" *(electric guitar, monster truck noises)*
- [ ] List this on the [Barfspace Vision Quest list][BVQL], with a cross-reference on the [Network Neighborhood quests arc][NetNQ]
  - [ ] Draft content in a quest on Visions.
  - [ ] Plan deployment by moving an action plan beyond content out as the "Selling Bagtent" quest being moved to a general Network Neighborhood movement quest.
