# Intractible Ontology

This is a little node for an idea that I've realized *concretely* thinking a bit about Kruskal's tree theorem: it can actually be *more complex than the material bound of the universe* to conclusively determine if an idea is "bigger" or not than another one. Like, it's not that it's *not possible* - it is *absolutely possible*, because TREE(3) is finite - but it is *physically impossible*, due to the way that pretty much any abstract symbol *could* manifest outside the bounds of the physically determinable universe.

The "biggest shared idea" that we can recognize is our Laws of Physics: we all seem to interpret the world at a common-enough interaction denominator that whatever we do within the "laws of physics" is undeniably shared, even without needing consciousness to perceive it. Like, yeah, a tree falling in the forest may not make a sound any of *us* can hear if none of us are there to hear it, but it makes a sound the *forest* hears. It falls, and if one stumbles upon it later, we see it as fallen. There is no disagreement between two parties about whether or not a stump is a standing tree, the way there would be about whether or not God exists in all of us.
