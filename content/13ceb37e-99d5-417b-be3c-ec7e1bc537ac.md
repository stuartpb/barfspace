# How I'm Writing with bagtent

See also the [general tooling and structure notes for bagtent itself][bagtent]

Oh geez, what was I going to write here... oh, yeah, derp, right, it's supposed to be a remake of the old Writing page, which I was originally going to internal-link to here, but I guess it's in Lean Notes? I guess that's what this is supposed to be describing, how I'm structuring my bagtent repos to hold all my writing needs, and how stuff is supposed to graduate / incubate / migrate / merge with them

Also gonna make a quick note about how there's, like, this idea where I'm putting files in places where there's a prominent link to them somewhere that I'll visit a lot so I don't forget about them - and how some of the places I've been too overwhelmed to revisit, like [the old docs/ folder of early barfspace meta essays][meta]

like for instance this file is linked on [Right Now][], which I intend to keep populating

just had the thought that these tab names not having any display for what the contents are is confusing, and something I'd want to be able to solve with some kind of plugin for titles in [wayside][] - did I already write something about "something that can get titles from a programmable source" somewhere, this idea feels familiar - was I maybe thinking about default commit messages, maybe an extension to git-slum (and/or autocommit) to make it (them) more bagtent-friendly? TODO look at issues when it isn't 1 AM and my head doesn't hurt

also, I need to split that bagtent notes page into a few files - one thing should be separating "plans" from, well, this: actually, what am I saying, I should just make this subsidiary to that, since it's really not worth distinguishing "how I am concretely structuring my own bagtent flowchart" and "thoughts I've had around the bagtent tools"

okay I just went and added a link over there

so I'm not liking how this isn't getting auto-committed right now, and that's really because I need to write the bagtent-sprout script so I never put the repo in an "invalid" state by way of committing too early

Okay, I forgot about this page for a while, that was probably a mistake, but oh hey, cest la barfspace

anyway, the thought I wanted to jot down real quick here is that barfspace is like, essentially it's like almost modeled as a neural network, with the way that cells create connections arbitrarily and sometimes structurally but those structures are organic, subject to change, damage, mutation - but the content remains.

in other words, and I think I've said this a few times somewhere else around here before, but barfspace is **the first writing structure I've created that feel like an accurate reflection of my brain**
