# original brainstorm / notes for dockitall all-linear-extrusion-bevel-fillet-boolean-based redux

these were notes I wrote when drafting the original idea for dockitall v0.2

> make "phone cross-section" module, which gets offset to form the vertical walls of the dockblock (which are then extruded)
>
> consists of hull of back and front corner circles with a front and back radius
>
> facing forward the body of the block can be a linear extrusion too (unified with the walls)
>
> extend the dockblock to the current hacky prism's base so it'll now be just cut under the Z axis
>
> have "just the plug" and "belt/ring for around case" printable draft test piece modules derived from some of the above structure
>
> front, back, and sides are also implemented as 2D shapes: walls are designed as intersections between the ring/belt top-down silhouette described above and the front / back halves of the block
>
> front can now be curved - start as square, then do speaker knockout by differencing the hull of some circles. You can difference circles from the negative to round corners more
>
> curving around the screen's corners contours would be cool, and making the back have rounded corners like the phone itself (while the wall around curves too) would be cool, but those *side* corners are what *really* need to be rounded
>
> ofc there's striping but that's already done

## one idea that didn't get done

> make the triangle a hull of "front-facing corner radius" circles

didn't do this because the front two corners are already like that, and the back one is cut for the cable track anyway.
