# how the graph of these notes mutates

When I was thinking whether to put this on the Worse is Better index or the Academy:

> I don't think there's a 100% overlap that would imply one should be a subset of the other, though the intersection may get a dedicated node

So, that's kind of a function of [the redundancy](09z2m-xactw-e091t-c32c7-2vr52), to highlight where there may be a strong independent semantic context that should be treated as its own subject

other causes to make a new page:

- incoming links only apply / refer to part of the page's subject matter
  - ways this can resolve:
    - the irrelevant matter gets linked out as its own page
    - the part many refer to gets its own page, which those links to the origin becoming either joined by or replaced with it
      - this is facilitated by never linking to pages subheadings. Or is it?
        - It kind of is, content-structure-wise: nothing ever needs to get *replaced* so much as it can be added to for the applicable link
