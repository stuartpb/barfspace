# Routerfying a HiveBug

This kind of overlaps with Studtop/Stubernetes ideas, and follows my "I'm not sure about that name" policy

Going back to my earlier iteration of this idea as Canbee, I was thinking it could make sense to have this as a router

and I think I saw a thing back when I was considering this idea

## Taking over partial functions from the router

One idea is that it could extend, and replace, parts of the router's functionality

## DHCP

It would be cool to be able to assign IP addresses based on mDNS / LLHDR or whatever name (whatever it is that my router shows in its hostname display)

## Hotspot / Wireless AP Connectivity

What would it take to make a Raspberry Pi's entwork interface as good as a proper router?

## Side processors

This is one of the things I'm thinking: wouldn't there be smoe piece of sidecar hardare capable of doing the BGP or whatever core functionality at the level of a home router?

Like, I don't know, an FPGA?

It would be *boss* if the Kubernetes node could control cluster routing as well as routing for devices connected to the network, idk
