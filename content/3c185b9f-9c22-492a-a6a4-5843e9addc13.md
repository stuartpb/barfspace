# A minimal subset of the DOM

Something I could really use for [hashsplat](92dc66f5-23e0-4790-ac34-6b18a76d0d98.md) is a library that's as lightweight as Cheerio, but browser-compatible like JSDOM.

I've carved a repo for this out at https://github.com/stuartpb/dum

I'm thinking now: what if this is just a collection of translation methods for document trees without DOM interfaces?
