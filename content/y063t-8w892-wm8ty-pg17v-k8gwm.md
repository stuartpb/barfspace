# Lean Notes

https://unusual.studio/projects/#850d26b9-565e-490d-9cfa-d90362cce442

This is the root node of a cluster collecting all my thoughts on best practices and how-to guides for pursuing any sort of project or idea, whether it be a book, or a Web app, or a board game, or a 3D model, or a screenplay, or a microchip, or an essay, or a robot, or a logo, or whatever.

This was the original repo where I started trying [bagtent][] as a content structure. It quickly expanded to incorporate my other big project of formless writing, [barfspace][], and then grew into this notes.stuartpb.com repo through [Project Akira][], work that now continues under [Operation Trapper Keeper][].

[bagtent]: q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3
[barfspace]: fyd6d-81rzj-g0892-971ke-k0dre
[Project Akira]: vbfwb-sefpv-wx8hg-5wts5-s3zmc
[Operation Trapper Keeper]: 3pgfc-7y2qe-xx9kp-q3y1z-1gnca

## Constituent Parts

There are currently a few pages that make sense as living "under the umbrella of Lean Notes", in some sense:

- [Zero to Software](gmpsm-6b804-gp8sy-hyne0-txv0w) covers the "classic" web-app-oriented scope of Lean Notes
- [Everybody Gets a Factory](hjyrc-z8tcf-8z9s0-yap0c-zx1wx) covers the "next level" of self-manufacturing (and how to scale that)
- [Understanding Lua](x9q4w-0xcq1-ra909-236fh-p7vk0) is a more narrative and abstract set of notes, but highly complementary to the overall project.
  - [Understanding Lua Season 2: TRON AS COSMOS](16xhv-pkpx4-pw96w-55mdn-6ghvn)

Pages will probably break out of these structures and copy between them over time, hopefully.

I'm thinking Zero to Software will get split a bit, so that the pages on web stuff will stay there, and a general "notes on structuring a code-adjacent project and using Git at the command line" can be merged into my [How I Start Projects](wz8g0-jttdx-84a1t-nbf0a-mc1hr) note (which can be renamed something like)

These notes also ought to integrate with [Primer Prime](pgcnd-4bg3j-86a7n-z4zt8-j6wme) - that would probably be another "lens" into a subset of the hierarchy, and interwoven with possible content for Understanding Lua

## the way the previous section was described in the root note before it got crammed back in

[Zero to Software](gmpsm-6b804-gp8sy-hyne0-txv0w), the original set of notes, has a lot of its current content in a bunch of Trello boards that haven't been copied here, and a lot of those Trello boards aren't even full of all that much content themselves.

[Everybody Gets a Factory](hjyrc-z8tcf-8z9s0-yap0c-zx1wx) is a more recently-worked-with body of notes on the general "maker" sphere.

[Understanding Lua](x9q4w-0xcq1-ra909-236fh-p7vk0) is kind of like Lean Notes, but instead, it's a draft for a graphic-novel-style introduction to key programming concepts through Lua.

## Meta boards

The Trello org for Lean Notes / Zero to Software included a few "Meta" boards (which I prefixed with `~` so they'd ASCIIbetically sort to the bottom):

- [History Journal](2z5ag-trq0n-qra4v-1ecke-jfv6e)
- [Influences and Prior Art](0mryg-ebcd6-aw9hf-7mqpk-z6v01)
- [Principles and Style](jdpsc-79b1h-md8f7-yfse5-c6fyj)
- [Introspection and Plans](55ph0-a1t6w-4wa52-x3dwc-qd5qr)
  - [Incubation page](rzv46-c6wcs-g4arv-6ajfn-8zq43)

This section could maybe get kicked out to its own page and linked through with the Department or Academy or Historium or something else in the HOTBAND (it fits pretty much all of them but the Ngineers)

Actually, let me take a step back:

- History, of course, falls under the Beyonder half of the Historium, and I guess it'd hold these other four links - for historical reasons.
  - It can be the authoritative node for "here's everything specific to the Trello days", where "Zero to Software" is the content page of the present, and the Department subsidiary is the content for the future of Zero to Software
  - I might add one more page, maybe reparented from somewhere around here, for documenting the awkward phase between Trello and The Notegraph where there was a Git tree branded as "Lean Notes". Isn't that what the Project Akira page has become?
    - Incidentally, it is kind of a shame that I couldn't really keep them disentangled, because if I had, I would have had a separate tree I could experiment with badifogu on.
- "Principles and Style" can subsume "Influences and Prior Art" and become the new headquarters for Continuing the Work of Glass-Tubes-Style Guidance In Notegraph Form under the Department (the Cliff Gardeners)? the "Influences" page could be considered an Academy thing, but it's relevant under the umbrella of "figuring out what it is exactly that this is supposed to look like, so I'm filing it there in my head
  - the History page would be linked, like Influences and Prior Art, to describe the trajectory.
- "Introspection and Plans" would theoretically fall under the Department (and Academy, for the introspection), but as it stands, what's left is relevant only to understanding earlier iterations of this project, and it would get merged in with the History Journal page.
- the Incubation Page would reparent to the Gardeners cuurently at Principles and Style.

### Stuff I Do in my Projects on GitHub

This was the bulk of an older repo originally named [how-i-roll][] that is only of historical interest today. See that page for what is now How-I-Roll's Tomb, where a general "prehistory of these notes" is being devised.

[how-i-roll]: qfntb-snnda-gx9ah-w284r-hwz8j

The remaining page about github repo/org creation, though, is still a solid jumping off point that can get integrated into this Lean Notes structure in some way (at which point, all these notes)

### appendage

There's also [this page][layout], which describes the overall layout of files in this repository (beyond the `content` directory), which was originally written on-the-fly when I was coming up with the structure for Lean Notes that would eventually turn into this repository (through applying the same structure to [barfspace][] and merging).
