# 12-factor system architecture under Kubernetes

somewhere around [the Module Tree design notes](10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md)

anyway Plusku should probably be using something more like Dockerfiles anyway

also, thinking now, maybe there'll be something like a "CI plugin suite" that has a specified directory to read as the Git root, and all the app plugins

also, new naming paradigm for Plushu: all plugins, instead of being prefixed "plushu", should be prefixed by the "project" whose philosophy they live under. so like the app-image-creation-from-git-hooks ecosystem should be one component, and the deploy-built-image-to-cluster should be another project that, like, kind of incorporates that?

## okay so here's one thing that can probably be better over images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/

under Helm the right way to make a config/release would be to have each release rebuild the chart with the selected ENV (if you want to keep to 12-factor restrictions)
