# Department of Barfspace

The Department of Barfspace is the district of notes concerned with introspecting the structure of the notes, and acting on that introspection by reshaping to fit. (This is a constant dance we do.)

Put another way: this is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way, as well as a collection of notes reflecting on patterns that have cropped up (especially through History Force)

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo][OBR].

## The Quests

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests][] was eventually divided up into three "domains":

- [Barfspace Operations][], dealing with legacies, maintenance and the like
- [Barfspace Visions][], dealing with new explanatory content and structure, aspirations like that
- Barfspace Implementations, which is transforming into a separate department (see "Adjunct" below)

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md
[Barfspace Operations]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[Barfspace Visions]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md

Most of the "quests" that were drafted before this split were very inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

In fact, this kind of not-having-a-page-for-individual-quests thing kind of dates back to back when conjuring pages was more awkward. Now, we're moving each of these quests to their own page, and as the pages get lighter (with the cruftier and more-confused pieces getting shunted out of sight), modern roles for these pages are emerging.

UPDATE: Actually, about half of Visions makes sense, and the other half is a bunch of irrelevant stuff embedded in those quests that needs a rescue party to detangle.

## Operation Headquarters and Reflection Points

- [Operation Trapper Keeper](1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md)
  - [Camp Papalima](4f705b65-cc3c-4f66-a256-ae5e5777d276.md) for Importing the Petlogs
- History Force, currently coalescing in a base camp at the foot of [how-i-roll's Tomb][]
- [The Right Near Office][TOTNE] (Thoughts on the First List of the Root Note)
- [The Edge Surveyors][etc](Thoughs on Miscellanea and the Last and Latter Lists of the Root Note)
  - [Collecting Links and Putting Them Somewhere][CLAPTS] (Organizing and Expanding the Linkdump)
- [The Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md) (Covering notes outside this note structure, how they're operating, links or why you can't see them, etc)
  - Thoughts on the Beyonder Consulate's jurisdiction [here](3c95ca30-d205-4f07-9c61-0087569bb13f.md)
  - [The Shadow Curtain](e50eb50f-cc83-43b5-888a-d2ae77daf8a5.md), for public notes about the creation of a body/bodies of bagtent notes in separate repostiroies
- [what's bappin' with musings](8fa02640-b218-40d4-8948-18bf0d441b22.md) (this will probably get a fancy division name at some point, and also probably drift apart from the Depart of Barfspace to become like the People's Free Insurgent Army of True Barfspace or some Temple of Barfspace thing or something)

## Adjunct

The [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) is kind of an affiliate agency to the Department of Barfspace, as they pave the way for and inform a lot of content work, but they aren't a content agency like the rest

## Aspirational Plans and Reflections / Prophecies and Brainwaves

- [Federating Barfspace](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md)
- [Lean Notes and Linkdumps](1cd51f38-b2df-49a5-99ad-b5629b3083b0.md) (kind of an artifact these days)
- [The Quest in the Quotes](73bf679b-4732-4ed1-929d-5dce9c163fd7.md) (a weird cluster of thoughts that isn't really a quest)

## Descriptional and Perscriptional Drafting

Examining my process enough to codify it has a weird way of leading to me trying to draftt new stronger rules for things I was only vaguely and inconsistently doing, so these tend to trade back and forth between descriptive and perscriptive

For more of this kind of process-examination-and-specification, check out the [Spec Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), which might get a joint-venture dedicated page for the describing-notes-as-they-work-in-this-repo documentation?

- [How I'm Writing With Bagtent](13ceb37e-99d5-417b-be3c-ec7e1bc537ac.md)
- [Shorthand for Placeholders](c5840859-b706-4750-8a14-0ae006f91ffa.md) (very messy legacy "quest")

## oh, uh, something else

I had this ["the meta page"](8c5a1d30-97d9-4395-85be-b6c8ba57b239.md) a while back that should probably be backtraced and rearchitected to point here and all, since Meta has ended up conglomerating around the structure enabled to act on it.
