# Prototype pearl print history

All of these pearls are printed with:

- 100% infill
- 0 solid top/bottom layers
- Support enforced for the first 20 layers

Pearl 2/59 is printed with Rectilinear infill, 2 shells

Pearl 29/32 is printed with Concentric infill, 0 shells

Pearl 21/40 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 2 Shells

Pearl 10/51 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 1 Shell

Pearl 11/50 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 3 Shells

Pearl 20/41 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 4 Shells

Pearl 12/49 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 5 Shells

Pearl 19/42 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 6 shells

Pearl 3/58 is printed with Rectilinear infill, 6 shells

Pearl 28/33 is printed with 15 shells (negating infill) - this is different from 0 Shells Concentric Infill because it fills gaps.

Pearl 27/34 is printed with 15 shells and the first layer being 0.1mm.

Pearl 4/57 is the same (salvage from a test to see if this thinner first layer, which has negligible improvement, would lead to reliability issues).

Pearls 6/55, 15/46, and 23/37 are all from a print run that got halfway through a 12-up print (see [this page](samgd-1g07x-mc94y-997wg-ypkcj)). This puts me halfway through having the whole strip beaded, though the pearls for either end still need to be designed, for how they're gonna be connected etc.

Pearl 14/47 came from a print that was cancelled watching the same plate for issues: turns out Slic3r isn't accounting for the cable bundle coming out of the extruder, which is what knocked the first piece off both times

At this point, I decided to go for all-at-one plates instead. This entailed a bunch of headaches, detailed [here](796xf-cy6dr-f08j6-mv77x-v4k4q).

I got all the common pearls except 5, 9, 13, 18, 22, and 26 done by the first plate, and the rest were attached with pearl-halves from the second.

The end pearls were also done as solid-shell: I might have printed some with a first layer of 210C, because I didn't select the specific filament, but at the center of the print bed by itself this wasn't so much of a big deal.

## use results

Pearl 10/51 came apart first: I'm replacing it with an all-shell pearl printed in PETG.

The same thing happened with 27/34, oddly enough.

After testing for a while, I've decided they don't color-blend as well as the PLA beads do: I'll probably replace them at some point in the future

## rebeads

I'm printing Natural Clear PLA to replace some beads that came off the necklace (note that these were all re-beaded at random in the car on my way to Halloween Horror Nights 2019, so relations between which beads fell off from what position no longer hold)

positions 5 and 9 were done from individual 2-up prints: I think one was an experiment with something like putting the tab forward

23, 17, and 14 all come from a 6-up plate with the As Much Support as Possible blocker/enforcer combo
