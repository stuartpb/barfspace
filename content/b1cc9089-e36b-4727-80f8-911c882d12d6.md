# HOARD Travel Baggage Protocol

This is a set of guidelines to follow to ensure containment and peace-of-mind when traveling, based on improved note integrity.

## Preparation and Planning

Use a Kanban-style board (such as Trello, or a physical notebook with many small sticky notes) with columns for:

- Unpacked at Home
- Packed
- On-person
- Unpacked at Destination

As you plan and build your list of things to pack, start anything you don't wear on you at all times (such as "wristwatch" , "retainer", or "wedding ring") in the "Unpacked at Home" list. (Put anything you could potentially lose, forget, or leave behind somewhere in the "On-person" section.)

Make distinguished (by a separate-color note or Trello label) cards for each bag you will pack (like "Backpack" and "Suitcase"), and put them in your "Packed" list.

## Packing and Traveling

As you pack items, move them from your "Unpacked at Home" list to your "Packed" list. Any items you put in a pocket or similar should go on the "On-person" list.

(NOTE: The "Unpacked at Home" list should travel with the rest of the board: even when you're at your destination, you'll want to have a clear idea of what you decided not to pack at the last minute, so you don't forget and wonder if you'd packed it.)

Once you remove items from your bags, move them from your "Packed" and "On-person" lists to your "Unpacked at Destination" list.

As you pack back up (either to leave or to move), move items from the "Unpacked at Destination" list back into position on the "Packed" list, under the bag they're packed into.

## Itinerary Accompaniment

You may also wish to include, in a space near to this information (such as a first list, on Trello):

- The trip's confirmation number
- The departure flight number and time
- The return flight number and time
- Connections, plane info, and arrival times
