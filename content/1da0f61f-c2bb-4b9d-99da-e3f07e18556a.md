# Operation Trapper Keeper

This is now the main note under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] for the continuing work of integrating outside content that began with [Project Akira][]. It's kind of a cursor for where a bunch of legacy work is at: a base camp to address newer developments in while trying to disassemble incomplete thoughts from a different time into pieces of a newer world, for structures from before the notes started coming in.

[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

I guess this could also be thought of as a sort of Ellis Island, a receiving port for outside content, since so much of it pertains to integrating material from my pre-merger writings.

For more information on things I'm struggling with in these notes, check the [News][] (though notes-news hasn't been authored so much lately as of early-June 2019, with more attention haivng been given to projects that are described here writing their plans in the spots where they're gonna be implemented - possibly a side-effect of this Department's infrastructure having developed out a bit, with abstract zones popping up like Camp Papalima and How-i-roll's Tomb to work like meta pages that can shift in focus between different "teams").

## Current sprint

The [June Judgment](b7b835c5-d843-4888-ae53-bd8aef36d5cd.md) is coalescing to consider a definitive plan for integrating my remaining lingering repos.

## Continuing operations

A History Force, developing a more robust archaeological infrastructure, inspired by a reread of the notes on Project Akira, has been moved to [how-i-roll's Tomb][])

[how-i-roll's Tomb]: bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md

History Force will continue to review non-historical comments on [the standing Project Akira page](dadfc5e5-cfb6-4f7d-88c0-bcd64b91feac.md), and work with the standing contingent of Opkeepers to integrate cut content that's still relevant into locations elsewhere in the Tree (maybe commissioning new branches under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB] to address unresolved points), and summarize / artifact the content that has a place in understanding the history there (remembering that non-summary versions of stuff that wasn't clear can be read through history, if there's "forensic" need to review exact wording).

[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

The continuing integration of petlogs is tracked at the outpost at [Camp Papalima](4f705b65-cc3c-4f66-a256-ae5e5777d276.md).

## Other remaining integrative work

Migrated from [the page that now lists divisions](a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md):

- [lingering tasks from after Project Akira](19189561-a743-4129-98ac-639817e09911.md)
  - [the planfile postmortem](f359a1e5-3e4f-4d30-8be3-0d0635c77ea4.md) still needs to be integrated better (TO DO: Work with History Force)
  - See the "detritus" below for what should become a dedicated Planfile Archaeological Expedition note
    - moving to [planfile historic expedition](aa9294c4-dabd-4638-a2db-5bbeb6236f8e.md) under the [Archaeology Force](eaaac719-db0f-4eeb-8d5d-bc1bcac57c82.md)
    - next to [The Right Now Outpost](ddde8098-c504-4113-a1e2-6540aeb16eb1.md)
- "Packing up the Old World", apart from the planfile stuff (which is *kind of* done?), is now *done* done (and has been deleted, since its remaining task descriptions were just redundant and confusing).
- Whether to merge or bolster [what's left in other repos](c139f558-e2a2-416d-9144-e101a9218820.md)
- There was a note about codifying the structure of Quests that I think is handled better elsewhere now.
