# The Museum of Notegraph History

This is the branch of the [Notegraph Historium](c4ab1f6b-cac2-4025-ae27-3b82f0a9d4c6.md) which collects artifacts and links to where they were pulled from, and weaves into some of the other studies from the [Academy of Belfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md)

See also [Stuart P. Bentley's Content Through the Ages](da311588-e9d8-4a56-898f-63934bcc0131.md) for records describing precents from *outside* these notes

## Notable historical locations

- [Quests](6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md), where my original active planning in these notes started, has since become obsolete
- [the original bagtent braindump](9432d8de-485e-4253-8dcb-e8ed3dda45f9.md)
  - collects the line of thoughts that were spit out in what would eventually become the more-robust [bagtent index](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md)

## Artifacts and stuff like that

- [On Right Now, News, and Quests](1d70b7d4-c95c-4ef0-a2a5-c1f94afca7fb.md)
  - reflections on three ways of presenting state that eventually became an obsolete concern
- [News for March to May of 2019](ca8263d8-e03b-44b1-a6b9-bfbc7d24311f.md)
  - This was an older way of looking at the notes's development without trying to split by subject
  - It led to things being forgotten a lot
  - This is why News is being deprecated
- [The Inline Rock](d0a8281c-6f97-4b05-88a4-8034fd4fa72e.md)
  - The mark that led me to inline all Markdown links I encountered.

## Historical Reflections and Documentation

- [Footlinks for Searching](88e5452a-c473-4be1-a1ca-2f6caed18657.md), a look back at what inspired the pre-inlining approach

## Modern pages

These, of course, are liable to turn from News to History at any time

This really ought to be a project of the [Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), with maybe a link under the Department that it should review these observations when charting new pathways

- [The Right Near Outpost](ddde8098-c504-4113-a1e2-6540aeb16eb1.md)
  - the pipeline from Journals to Lean Notes
- [Journalling and Checking In](74453d4a-1474-47d7-a813-cc39cf773bcc.md)
  - stuff like Right Now and Petlogs

the [Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md) tracks other constructions that are currently maintained outside the notes
