These are projects that'll do best with lots of people contributing to them.

- [OPWS](2h7ch-fepsd-xqamr-3j43v-dbd8j)
- [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words (ODRW)](zpecy-dqpw1-wva8n-kf2kk-6kcr4)
- Keyboard shortcut collection? Is that still a thing?
- [envigor](4sfj7-qj4bn-7kasz-36wcb-cp0w2) is kind of like a search for all hosted service/infrastructure providers
- Perspective Quantities
- [a copylefted mindfulness resource](x20qp-e0ckr-4eakw-mj7e3-9vemm) is something a bunch of people would be more qualified to write than me
