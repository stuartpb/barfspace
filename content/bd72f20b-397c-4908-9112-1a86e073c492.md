# On "Fanfiction"

> Roger Myers, Jr.: Okay, maybe my dad did steal Itchy. But so what? Animation is built on plagiarism. If it weren’t for someone plagiarizing The Honeymooners we wouldn’t have The Flintstones. If someone hadn’t ripped off Sergeant Bilko, there’d be no Top Cat. Huckleberry Hound, [Chief Wiggum][], Yogi Bear, hah! Andy Griffith, Edward G. Robinson, Art Carney. Your Honor, you take away our right to steal ideas, where are they gonna come from? *(points to Marge in the galley)* Her?

Who's writing Batman, Superman, Spiderman, Captain America today? Were they not fans? Are they not now fans? The creators of all these characters are dead: continuation through imitation used to be how culture was built, before the momentary perversion of creativity under the misguided knuckle of American copyright law in the 20th century.
