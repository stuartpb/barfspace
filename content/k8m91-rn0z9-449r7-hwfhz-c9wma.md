# The Method Lab

(Not to be confused with [the Arizona-based video production agency of the same name name](http://www.methodlab.com/).)

This is my home base for [methods engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_engineering) and that class of thing. [Time and motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study), things like that.

It's somewhere between Lean Notes protips, Projects, and Messays (especially the [big ones][] in which they share the original impulse of having dedicated repos created for them in the Pre-Notes Era of [My Old Bad Ideas][MOBI]), as well as the [Wellness and Fitness index][WAFI] and some degree of all the other stuff that's linked off from Right Now

[big ones]: w3y50-zq5xh-wh97v-mv9nd-xmdg6
[WAFI]: 423z3-ntnzb-cba98-01wkc-5f427
[MOBI]: yfsxd-ek388-ct9ye-xb9we-qb9mj

What gets drafted here: procedures, standards, guidelines... all that fun boring stuff

These are influenced by the thoughts collected at [The Spiral Mountain of Design and Social Psychology](8p7rm-5qj6z-we8w5-t78g4-7698p)

see also [Component Projects](sgm3d-n5d7z-ra8jx-4r3y6-cd6rp), many of which can feel like abstract methods at times

- [Project HOARD](nd790-ppvk3-42aab-ckxbw-ds364)
  - [2K19 Nexus](fcs87-zdthb-ysa95-qmym6-k3py3)
  - [Baggage packing procedure](p7691-2f3dd-r781y-4h3j4-2t4pp)

Other stuff to be merged in there is listed in the repos leaning toward merging in under "Merging Versus Supporting Existing Works" list on the [Barfspace Operations][BOPS] page. (SACRED?)

[Extreme Open Notes](5xgm1-9dqk3-vza3h-mr3y5-vz2n1) is an offshoot specifically thinking about generalizing the structure around [Lean Notes](y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm), currently kept here in case I ever move forward with that

BISNES/BIGDOG could probably be introduced here

[BOPS]: mfrzq-ch8r8-wj9a3-bdbdx-ffkc4

Kind of like this is the [household experience page][HousE], potentially - right now it's just a thing about dishwashing but that's still procedure-like

[HousE]: 9wgd5-54wbb-rb92f-6bsrb-jm0s5

Specs I think make more sense in dedicated, structured repos, but there definitely might be a shadow nexus somewhere on here for unstructured thoughts on specs

at some point [my loadout system][Loadout] might be turned into some kind of template, which would go here.

[Loadout]: v75m1-h5gr2-g499k-2g6fe-s65rq

[Triage methods for early development](x29n2-7jhnr-44amk-q6cyr-q0jgw)

## methods that are definitely for programming

- [FLOC Estimation](37kyc-qy8tt-a8a9c-n2s7e-63xjw)
- [Evergreen Targeting](kr1bf-p2qkh-0qbff-8r8yq-ktj6z)
  - [Best Practices for Modern ES Projects](b57nn-27xma-g9axf-r6dhz-gmg0g)
- [Rethinking Release Channels / Versioning: The EARS Model](h63nv-gx8s7-078bc-cjsrg-ry6jb)
- [Markdown document loose structured data model](g6k8m-cw8ed-47awn-3jp7d-k8vck)
  - TODO: link this in with other "Semantic Markdown" notes
- [3D Print Artifact Versioning](psd23-mzd7m-ccam8-gj5na-h818e)
- [Identity Management Super-Best Practices](7xr1k-yvmxb-f9bzc-9sgqg-bf542)
  - (ie. practices so good, almost nobody is following them yet)
- [best practices for curlable Bash](bwtpt-yap86-m9ak8-px93d-a1c8n)

## micro-methods / style guide components

- [complex manual of style / linting rules](9gae4-9g2dp-wca2w-z2dm6-cx2at)
- [folding-style indentation/line continuation](eh1xw-hwqn2-ca83q-b1w03-zfv0n)
- [In Praise of Modular Standards](1jhyq-xpk6x-85967-6vy3d-tpaky)

## less method, more schema

- [Schema State of the Art](93gsh-tg5pd-83b8j-wyd50-a41we)
- [ULID UUID compatibility](f5gzh-cwdax-638zw-38z9g-9wwwj)
- [spec brainstorms](c8v67-hch62-6aa79-rt6zm-8tc4t) is more concretely about data structures and the like: lower-level stuff than what's on this page.
- [alternatives to white/blacklist](fhbcn-8j84z-m18g6-dz8v4-jfn0m)

## somewhere else around this method lab

should probably be added to a few more pages:

- [drag screw rotate zoom/unzoom](80dvc-62cj4-t49h1-xv6zg-msb0p)

## other end of the spectrum

- this page [ought to be merged with specs laws](5hjb8-ed2b8-xbam8-nqj0a-dhzc4), once I remermber where I put it

## See Also

- [xxiivv](https://wiki.xxiivv.com/#about), which are like "this, but polished"
- fitting in with this might be my series/whatever around [Dynamicland](7ck6y-g3amh-ksaex-1wypm-ns3gw) and the last of the weird mutant laboratories
