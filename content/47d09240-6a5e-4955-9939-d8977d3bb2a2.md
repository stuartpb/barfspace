# Loose Threads and Blackbeard's Treasure

They say that Blackbeard buried 10% of his treasure 6 feet deep, and he buried the rest 20 feet deeper.

Why's that? Because, if nobody knows they should keep digging, they'll stop.

Essentially, when it comes to classification, you need two kinds: secrets where the existence of the secret is known (ie. people know where they'd need to go for access) and secrets where *the existence of the secret is secret*.

These levels are contextual, based on what the reader knows. If anything from the second class jumps to the first class, it's a leak.
