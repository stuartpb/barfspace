# stuzzy todo

- add the thing so bash completion is case insensitive
- Is there a way to fix the mei_me errors on startup?

## QEMU

want to look into booting sturling/stuquart via VM

## GNOME issues

- change the default color scheme that applies to Terminal to be dark?
- make it so gsudo doesn't prompt me for my password, just like sudo?
  - might need to switch to pkexec: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/174214/is-there-a-graphical-sudo-kdesudo-gksudo-su-to-root-tool-that-works-pas/174249
- upstream touchpad patch in gtk+
- what is the deal with these ligatures in monospaced text? it's happening in Google Chrome, and it sucks.
- Someone needs to tell GNOME "Disable until Tomorrow" for a program that goes from sunrise until sunset (Night Light) should use a definition of "tomorrow" that isn't based around 12:00 AM :facepalm:
- Could have the decency to bring a window I'm trying to drag a file into to the front after a second, like maybe rearrange the windows a little or just make it so it's not too tough to refocus on the original window if you need to drag back to the original (ie. if the whole original window was within the bounding box of the target, move the window to the edge nearest where the cursor entered, off by like half the icon size or whatever), and returning to the original returns focus immediately so you don't end up in the "oh I've made a mess of these" state

## Atom tweaks

- Is there an option to always Reveal in Tree View whenever you switch to a buffer for a file that's within your project? Should this be a package? Is there already one?
