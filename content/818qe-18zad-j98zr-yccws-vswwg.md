# plans for a Notestack namespace

like maybe notestack.stuartpb.internal (and potentially notestack.stuartpb.com once it's public-exposable)

- GitLab
- GitPod
- JupyterHub
- dat

this is gonna be on the backburner until I'm confortable with [household-workspaces](k1c34-ncewq-cdanq-mjvfe-y07w3) at least
