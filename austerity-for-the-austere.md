> Following my excursion down to Renton, autoload on my Orca card bounced due to an expired payment method: they make you actually *call and talk to somebody* to rectify this (even *after you fix the payment problem*), which is ridiculous, and something really ought to be done. (I did end up resolving this, but I'm lucky to have the privilege to be able to make calls like that, especially when so many who *do* ride the bus *aren't* so lucky.)

This making-things-hard-on-the-ones-who've-got-it-hard pisses me off *so* much.
