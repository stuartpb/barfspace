- The Login Arc
  - [devising the user outlay](kwy8k-vpnsm-c8a8y-550mm-htkwy)
    - This started out as a plan to rename `chip` to `stuart`, hence why it's named like that
    - the actual plan deviated quickly
    - this can be fixed in a later round of edits

    - also I kind of solve bluetooth?
    - [one-ff comment about installing `pavcontrol`](e4ya8-r308q-03a76-6mnxx-nw4h3)
      - I think one of these mentions it was too big
  - [oof, PocketWM](7515x-h3cq6-f6acw-771bk-1g0ap)
    - ends with SSH setup
    - these parts should really get split to separate nodes
