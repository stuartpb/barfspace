## To-do-later features

Template formatting:

- JS template-string (`${}`) / "EJS" syntax
  - maybe as hyperHTML to allow for HTML formatting where the user opted into it without
- Pug
- Handlebars or hogan or magnum or whatever
- MailChimp / whatever ESP formatting with `%%Percents%%`
  - This is also, what, Windows templating? Batch echo? Visual Basic?
- Shell-quote syntax (though that's pretty much just the JS syntax with optional braces)
- Go template syntax?
- Maybe just a "gimme the kv pairs as CSV with two rows and here's the command to run" or something so people can write it in Lua or M4 or whatever, then we buffer it from stream

- DKIM? https://nodemailer.com/dkim/
  - I feel like the ESP is expected to handle DKIM?
  - Maybe this can be added as a feature for providers that don't do this sort of DKIM integration
  - And maybe there can be helper commands for generating a keypair and DNS entries?

## ES Modules style

I tried to do this, but the need for a flag, plus the [troubles around ESM in binaries](https://github.com/nodejs/modules/issues/152), made me decide to pass up [my own best practices](594f5a88-fda2-4a09-aebf-066c7f0a3ff0.md) and stick with implicit-cjs for everything. (Those will become best practices once the flag is unnecessary.)

I considered https://github.com/standard-things/esm
