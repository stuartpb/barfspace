# Browser Extensions

These are in the process of being ported to the [WebExtension API](34349df2-97b4-4095-8df4-d37056211e46.md):

- [NilPass](7e171d29-590d-4636-9c2e-80cdaef10e92.md)
- The one that takes specimen snapshots of pages and posts them to Gist
  - Previously the OPWS Surveyor, but most of the planned features for that extension will be rolled into NilPass
- KeyboardLeopard I guess
- Hey wouldn't it be cool if I brought back Clipsnail?
- Rejig would maybe be applicable for Firefox as an alternative to re-running webext

## Tab-and-window-related projects

These would all be applicable one level up in a [Windowsystem Metabrowser](20768279-9c6d-4476-90d8-9dd15f3aa4d3.md)

- [Tabalanche](1bba5664-3cd1-4f22-903b-fd35c6844ac0.md)
- [Scrollbar Bookmarks](608f02cd-baa0-4426-ac27-469b585a2c4e.md)
