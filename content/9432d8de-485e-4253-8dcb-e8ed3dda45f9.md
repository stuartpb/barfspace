# bagtent braindump 2018

this page aggregates concepts that were originally written in a mishmash brainstorm for [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md)

it's pretty much just a historical artifact at this point (for retrieving context to understand these disjoint writings) - see the bagtent index proper for a better-structured tree

- [bagtent-sprout and bagtent-top-links](31396cb8-8b5e-4433-9174-c06b0bb0a9ed.md)
  - [link suggestion dropdown](afacb4de-3f79-416e-a55a-1d36178085cc.md)
- [this idea about the uniqueness of footnames](7f3d8fbc-67ba-4267-902e-f9628207d18f.md)
  - this was originally moved to a node for [style guide and best practices](70fa4c0d-914b-4e59-9a26-e1b3c99573e6.md)
  - it was moved out when [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md) supplanted it
    - the thought that caused that shift is archived as [Inline Rock](d0a8281c-6f97-4b05-88a4-8034fd4fa72e.md)
  - This swoopty-relinking in its referencing, and the way this actual described convention changed, should both be documented around The Oozy Sewer
    - I think the latter is at least somewhat remotely linked in
- [extending and enhancing the basic bagtent model](539e354a-b20e-4ea3-9bdc-14cddac5cd76.md)
- [notes on mixing content types](b2dade14-8a6c-4643-9fdb-2fc6b441016c.md) (kind of interplays with "extending")
- [thoughts on "aliases" for short, fixed page names](6dfcd6df-31e9-46bb-9b75-d750a5456de8.md)
