# A Parallel Pipe with a Serial Spigot

This was going to be a thing about ADHD, but I tried bagtent-conjure and it produced the second-lowest UUID we've had so far and since I've got this whole thing about not wanting to make a new UUID for shuffling meanings around, and this UUID just showed up at the next conjuring, I'm choosing to take this as a sign and then come back to this later

Okay, so, it's *really* frustrating when my brain starts charging ahead on two fully-driven and separate trains of thought, it's handling both of them, but it can't keep the things it's developed in its hands for very long (it's like I've got two chutes that limes come out of, and I can't catch the limes from both chutes)...

that kind of sums up what it feels like. it's like one of those Game and Watch games where you've got stuff coming in from the top, or like one of those Lego game mid-level bonus sequences where you fly through the air and want to line up to pick up the highest number of studs, and you've got these two huge chains, but you can't figure out which one has more value, so you try to wiggle the joystick all over and you catch some of both, but you didn't pick anything up in the time when you were floating between chains, so you didn't end up picking up that much.

and, like, I guess I just wish I had a co-op partner to grab the other chain, I guess? that's what it feels like? The thing that kills me is that I've got these multiple parallel though processes both producing extremely important thoughts, and I know that if I don't take notes on the one I really care about, I'm going to forget it forever, because I have no short-term memory.

This is something that'd probably be helped by a Mindfulness Quest (todo: link to that arc page after [Quests][] is split into arcs

I should see that movie Theory of Everything, because the way to describe what the PPSS aspect of ADHD feels like, it as the feeling like my entire body is fighting me and I'm trapped inside it, like I'm supposed to have 38 arms and 36 of them have seized up in paralysis.
