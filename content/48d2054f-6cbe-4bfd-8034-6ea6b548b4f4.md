# Fresh New PrusaPrint OctoPi from itself

Going through the wizard...

Until I figure out my SSH situation, I'm going to disable Access Control and just not expose this machine to the Internet

Skipping the CuraEngine thing since I'd rather develop a plugin that uses PrusaSlicer

Setting the default name of the printer to "Prusa i3 MK3S" (the initial suggestion being MK3, and I added the S)

Not screwing with the profile parameters since I'm sure these are all correct by Prusa's reckoning

Restarting so the server can restart

Hitting "Update Now"

this takes a while

Rebooted, takes a while

Wizard is prompting me for anonymous usage contribution, I click "sure why not"
