# Stuart P. Bentley's Jon Bois Fan Page

this is just a little nook I'm carving out for Thoughts on Jon Bois, which I have

I have this idea for a collage of a whole punch of different Jon Bois projects just collected in one room:

- the [Surrender Index][punts] and [Batless Barry Bonds Simulator][Bonds]
- the [Card Board][cards], maybe with the [Bob][bob1] card at the top
- The broken clock from the [ERROR] phase of the Troy-DeVry video
- A calendar for 17776, possibly counting [the number of days in a week][DBA]
- A pair of sneakers advertising Hitch as seen in the Tim Tebow CFL Chronicles
- maybe a bottle of milk labeled "Milks" in homage to Clarence BEEFTANK
- [The 1904 St. Louis Olympics Board Game][RPaB]
- The food from the [Saddest Supperjump][supperjump]

I'm also thinking, what if there was a giant globe in the background, with all the models and stuff spread out across it, and it's called "Jon Bois' Earth"
