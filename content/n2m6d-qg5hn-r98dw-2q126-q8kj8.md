# "Original" Premises

I had this idea that's kind of like Ryan North's Machine of Death, but for time travel (and no, that's not How To Invent Everything) - it's a framing device for how to do stories about *competing modes of time travel*: [Timebag](yc80r-dc2bm-4c87r-kc54t-jte3e)

it also has some fun thoughts on Canonicity and Inspiration such that should probably get their own notes, describing how a distributed writing project might be approached (especially in a bagtent-like model). They'd live along [this note about fanfiction](qnsf4-2ssfj-88924-gtgvg-77h4j) that's on [the "Derivative" work page](qx09b-0eqa8-wta11-k000n-0yt49)

There's also this *old* idea, way old, I tried to manifest here: [Glitchless](1dmrd-r5wq2-md9bn-7qz5z-3tnrx)

There's another weird little one-off novel concept I wrote a few lines for: [Rimraf](vsx2d-e73n0-rp90h-129d6-882t0)

Oh, I've also had my long-running idea for a Movie To End All Movies, one that I've only really found the guts to lean into now that I've found Eris: [Aneris](axgdv-sah9c-6n8hg-gdqvf-wcm41)

There's also this thing that's based on the first dream I had that left me *shaken* when I woke up: [Luc Curios](kbvav-jfn7r-m19ww-nnvk4-kae4h)
