# Chao Garden redux

OK, so, the original tweet was suggesting a standalone Chao Garden, but honestly, I think the appeal was pretty much how it was a full-time-playable little side game that could interact with your main game.

Like, I'd love a game that lets you, like the helmet in Fantastic Contraption, jump into a little pocket universe that;s a Chao Garden like game, and it can work like teleporting to your home base in Minecraft, you can go around and snuggle pets and feed stuff and move stuff around in crafting ovens and even build new crafting apparatuses?

that'd be a cool game, you could give each Chao a job instead of redstone
