# Thoughts on the jurisdictional duties of the Beyonder Consulate

Old GitHub structure doesn't count, that's just an adjunct operation within the mainline historian duties (though that will probably be a focus of the how-i-roll Trapper Keeper work)

This will probably start a joint venture with History Force for documenting archaeology into older note structures like OneNote and Trello

The Beyonder Consulate always has a close relationship/rivalry with [Operation Trapper Keeper][], which wants to integrate notes, and especially those in foreign historic predecessors: having the Beyonder Consulate do a thorough documentation job makes it easier to pass off to History Force without having to go through Archaeology Corps
