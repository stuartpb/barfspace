# HTML Email Notes

> Between desktop, mobile, and Outlook, HTML email is a three-headed dog from hell.

## What makes HTML Email different from HTML pages?

The main thing is that stylesheets have historically been mangled by email clients (likely going back to the Hotmail days when nobody wanted to load a whole iframe for messages, but also didn't want selectors potentially affecting the outer UI), so **all styles have to be inlined**.

There's also the whole thing where **remote resources like images don't load by default**, because it's a form of information leakage to retrieve them

Outlook up through 2013 uses Microsoft Word to render, which can't handle proper CSS positioning, so if you want to support this old crap you need to abandon all modern best practices and write horrendous HTML for a world where Internet Explorer 6 just came out

There are probably other weird things, too - all the historic weirdness around email is still a concern, for instance (meaning you *need* a plaintext fallback)

## Some good primers around this

NOTE: This would probably make sense as something to incorporate into a Lean Notes page on email, which could then link to this page

- [Lee Munroe's Smashing Magazine article from January 2017](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/01/introduction-building-sending-html-email-for-web-developers/) is a great all-rounder

## Other (primary) resources

- [Really Good Emails](https://www.reallygoodemails.com/) has a bunch of real-world samples that you can gank techniques from, or rip off wholesale
