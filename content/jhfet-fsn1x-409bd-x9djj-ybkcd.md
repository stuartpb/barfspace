# Getting to Know Nix

You know, there are ways to have Nix eat an existing Linux installation. stushiba has a lot of cruft built up in its run environment, and between this and stuzzy (and potentially sturling), it's starting to be a bit like a monoculture. Maybe it's time to make the switch to a system with fully declarative configuration state?

Thinking I might look into what'd be involved in replacing the Arch installation on stushiba with Nix.
