# Right Now: Anything New, Exciting, or Different

This is a page pointing to pages for stuff that's on the forefront of my mind, sort of like an "open tabs".

I overhaul this page every six months or so, generally after having stalled on updating it for a while: [here](36b6c0cc-cae0-4ff2-acdd-f3be5a157ef1.md) are some previous snapshots.

## April 2020

TODO: integrate my [watch strap notes](b194cbe8-90c1-4a0c-8996-8bbcb6fce221.md) somewhere (notes on my loadout)

stuff below is from mid-january 2020

## To write up

I migrated my Cloud9 workspaces, I meant to write up how that went down

## Phone drama

Juust got my phone back online.

Working on a [dock](c35f78b3-9cbb-4f26-ae38-fd4321589947.md), might like a better [case](1dfa9859-4254-40bc-809f-d338214d1e43.md)

Hustling to [get rebble working](06aac3c2-23fd-4c45-8ec4-8d02e245411e.md) so I can use my watch like I want

## Kubernetes thing

In reflection, I need to be able to provision workspaces like I could in the Cloud9 days. Not being able to do that easily iskilling me.

Getting into GitPod (proving I'm a real OSS developer for unlimited time) might help in the interim, but ultimately, the right solution is to run my own Kubernetes cluster

## Joycons

Got some Joycons RMAed, might be worth gethering some notes re: that

## Futon

Need to get some parts warranty-replaced on my futon

## Work

bleh, not moving like I wish it was

## NeckFX

Working on a better control core

## 3D Printer

got an MMU, it's pretty cool

calling this "Stuworks" now since it's a proper whole fancy assembly ecosystem now, with stuflair doing the files and... name to be determined for the OctoPi endpoint, I guess (stupiece? stuplots?)

## Vive

Not yet set up.

## Apartment

Just moved in in December
