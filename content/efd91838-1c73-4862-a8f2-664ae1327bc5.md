# My build number and model notes

## Origin

Bought from Walmart.com in early March 2020

## Numbers

Making a note of my build number: RCT6873W42BMF9A-ANDROID8.1-V09-V1.25.101-A04

The on-board manual lists the model number as "RCT6873W42 / RCT6873W42KC", with a "F9" in a circle to the right of that. There's also a circled "BC" in the bottom-right corner.

The enclosed paper Quick-Start Guide lists the model number as RCT6873W42KC (at the top and in FCC compliance info), and has a circled "BC" in the top-right corner (under a QR code which doesn't look useful, probably a document identifier)

Popping the tablet out of the case says it's RCT6873W42KC on the device housing (yes, it says that on the body of the tablet, not the case, so "KC" isn't just the accessory/SKU)

The case's model is RKT773P (this is also listed in the Quick-Start Guide's FCC info, noting "Equipment tested for compliance as a complete unit")

the FCC compliance info on the *housing* (next to the model number) lists "FCC ID: A2HRCT6773W22" and "IC: 9903A-RCT6773W22" - note that the suffix is the model number for a *different tablet*, which is curious

The tablet has a serial number printed (not embossed) on the bottom edge (with "(M8)" after a space at the end), and this serial number is on the box

The box says "RCT6873W42KC C" with an "F9" in a circle next to it, above the UPC - underneath, it says "CHARCOAL", which is probably what the "C" stands for (ie. that's an SKU-only detail)

The box also has a circled "BC" on the bottom (opposite end from the UPC flap), making me think this was probably a proofing-revision identifier SKU-wise - it also has a QR code under the flap

## Understanding the model number components

Contrasting with [other Voyager / RCA Tablet models](27e3eedf-83d3-4c7a-920e-27e4303801b5.md)

"RCT6873W42" is the base model number for some-to-all Voyager tablets (not sure when it actually diverges from that?)

Like, Intel Voyagers and MTK voyagers both

I'm pretty sure "KC" is for Keyboard Connector, since that's the actual device variant (the SKU is also KC, but, y'know)

Not sure what the "BM" in the build number denotes - possibly "Based on Mediatek"? Could have something to do with the parentetical M at the end of the serial number

F9 is clearly some manner of hardware revision identifier (cf. it's next to the model where it counts)

Not sure about the final trailing A

the "M8" at the end of the serial number might be another kind of model identifier like F9, or it might be an origin thing

## Possible coincidences

The "F9" seems to mirror the "V09" in the build number?

"BM" might have something to do with the "BC" on the manual?

the A could have something to do with the ending "A04"

the "M8" at the end of the serial number might have something to do with how it shipped with Android 8

## Raw conjecture

The A denotes "Android"

The A most likely stands for "America", as there's another extant variant with an "E" suffix
