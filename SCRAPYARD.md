# SCRAPYARD #

I think I'm going to try having this as a loose dump file for me to paste in things that I've typed up in replies to people (or otherwise drafts of messages) that I ended up scrapping, instead of keeping them in loose notes in Google Keep (where these first few examples came from).

God, all this work is super great, but it makes me really wound up and leaves me needing to hug my little stuffed corgi roundboye to decompress and not feel like a big grouchy butt who is a grouch so much

Roughly translated, with the aid of Bing:



"heck then, i like the little cats

fuck me, aren't they cute?"

*note: this was going to be my reply to something on Twitter, unfortunately I didn't save a link to the original tweet*

For anybody who hasn't played Fiasco, you don't need any kind of experience playing the game to design a playset: it's just a few lists of various kinds of things (like locations, props, and relations between characters) that you might find in a given setting.
