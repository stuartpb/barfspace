# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose kind of overarching contexts that are constantly shifting. You might be able to get more context from the [Meta][] page, but I doubt it.

## Plans and check-ins

[Right Now][] is an index page for a bunch of pages that give insight into what I'm up to (that is similar to but doesn't *quite* match the list below, because it covers smaller stuff and isn't updated as much):

- [Quests][], which has kind of turned into my "To Do" lists
- [News][], the most distinctly journal-esque division of notes
- [pet machines and broken things][PMBT]
- [Project ideas][projects]
- [Spec Lab][Lab], where experimental best practices are drafted
- [Journeys][Study], my self-teaching study notes
- [Bureau of Construction][metaplans], the currently most-active headquarters for notes on these notes

## Lean Notes

Lean Notes is a series of notes sharing my expertise in various fields (here's [its original README][Lean Notes]) which, in its original Trello-based draft/incarnation, I tried to pursue across two orders:

- [Table A][]
- [Table B][]

[Lean Notes]: f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md
[Table A]: c8c4173e-e0ca-4218-a33a-e5b0ae48e9ef.md
[Table B]: ac01173b-4650-4609-aa84-0ded42714396.md

Note that there are a couple more pages listed on the Lean Notes page that aren't listed on either of these tables.

There's also [this page][layout], which describes the overall layout of files in this repository (beyond the `content` directory), which was originally written on-the-fly when I was coming up with the structure for Lean Notes that would eventually turn into this repository (through applying the same structure to [barfspace][] and merging).

[layout]: b651b62a-9906-4a3d-943b-93d19e4153d7.md
[barfspace]: 7f9a66a0-38fc-49e0-8489-270cdd3036ee.md

## Understanding Lua

This is kind of like Lean Notes, but instead, it's a draft for a graphic-novel-style introduction to key programming concepts through Lua.

Right now, it lives kind of outside of these notes: I've started an [Understanding Lua root][] for bringing it in from its current home.

## More freeform / creative-writing-type stuff

much of which dates back to the pre-bagtent era of [barfspace][]

- [Meditations and Musings][MnMs], which is sort of a catch-all for standalone pages in these notes that have some kind of philosophical or pragmatic topic
- [Raw emotional stuff][raw] - for when it's like that, but it's *way* less easy to articulate cleanly
- [Silly shit][tumblr], for shitposts
- [Pitches and Scripts][], for story premises, character study, dialogue bits, things like that - this is really a kind of big subsection of the notes, really.

[MnMs]: 8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md
[raw]: a281eee4-5e61-4026-846a-40fed7d38db9.md
[tumblr]: e1cae26c-3271-48ac-aa0c-a085fa4aa211.md
[Pitches and Scripts]: b297a6f8-5646-4ce1-9be1-d7ed6056a513.md

## Reactions

[The Tasteland][Tastes] is a branch of the notes where I'm keeping reviews and things like that

[Tastes]: 6661cd90-c9a6-4f7a-97cc-3eb47f9dee2e.md

## Collections

Here are some pages that just collect links to stuff so I don't forget it (and an [index page][metalinks] for linkdumps that aren't top-level like these).

- [Stuff I Have Read][read collection]
- [The Linkdump][]
- [My Old Google Bookmarks][Old Bookmarks]

[metalinks]: 0f18ba9f-dc5f-4b1a-a5da-50d09ce3e9d3.md
[read collection]: 2593b86b-8504-4c6e-af09-501c6a54ef67.md
[The Linkdump]: 1337e279-9790-4c24-aeeb-56337c994726.md
[Old Bookmarks]: 878e8967-fa5d-423d-8ac0-b369138ae10f.md

## Miscellanea

Here's the long tail of where notes that don't easily fit in any of the cleaner buckets above fall:

- [The Rest][]: for when I really, really, really don't want to classify something as any of the above
- [Appendices][], single-document clearinghouses for various bite-sized thoughts
- [Loose Notes][]: The Last Appendix, for ideas that don't even warrant their own page, and don't already have a suitable appendix page I can figure out right when I need to start writing them. I can tear them off and give them pages (possibly sorted, even) or move them to an Appendix later.

[Appendices]: f161276f-fd3c-49bb-93b1-3e99aab9e266.md
[The Rest]: fd071a93-8373-4adc-84c6-ae781c7d0442.md
[Loose Notes]: ff47c3c8-6686-4225-ba27-23f61c604e0d.md
