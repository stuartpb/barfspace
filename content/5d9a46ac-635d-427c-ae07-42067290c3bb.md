# HTML Email Templates

## [Litmus Community Templates](https://litmus.com/community/templates)

Pros:

- Aggregates a handful of different creators

Cons:

- Requires login to download
- Prioritizes Mailchimp and CampaignMonitor
  - Not sure why it has "versions" for these

## [htmlemail.io](https://htmlemail.io/)

Pros:

- Lee Munroe is legitimately an authority on this stuff
- Probably the most robust and service-agnostic collection of tooling and knowledge on html email out there

Cons / bad smells:

- weird gross gumroad paywall overhead around getting the templates
- more focused around use case (ie. "here's a forgot password email") than aesthetics
- exit intent spam
- just generally gives me that "someone here is trying to screw you" marketing-speak vibe
