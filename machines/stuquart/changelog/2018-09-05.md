# 2018-09-05: How to Move On (Without Actually Moving)

I have an old 500GB 2.5-inch hard drive that I used some years ago to run Windows 8 on my desktop (because the drive was on sale for cheaper than any desktop drive or something like that).

Today, I'd like to have a clean installation of Windows 10 that I can boot from an UEFI machine, so I'm going to take that Windows 8 installation and see if I can juggle some drive characteristics and the Windows 10 install media and get that BIOS/MBR Windows 8 installation upgraded to an EFI/GPT Windows 10 installation (it's cool, I have multiple legitimate Windows 8 keys).

Before I do any of this, because I don't actually want to lose any data from my old Windows 8 installation (though I'm also not such a fool that I intend to *actually upgrade* the Windows 8 installation - I will, of course, try as hard as I can to start the Windows 10 installation from scratch), I have imaged the entire drive, so that, in the worst-case scenario where I completely botch everything, I can still revert to the way things were. (See the stushiba changelog for 2018-09-03.)

With that out of the way...

## converting the drive from MBR to GPT

I looked into it, and Windows can really only work off of a GPT if the drive it's installing to is already formatted as GPT going in, so the first change I'm making to the disk is to convert that Master Boot Record it had from back in the Win8 days to a GUID Partition Table. Looking at [the ArchWiki documentation on this](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gdisk#Convert_between_MBR_and_GPT), I run this command (from stushiba, the machine where the disk is currently physically mounted, and where I did the initial imaging a couple days ago):

`sudo sgdisk -g /dev/sdb`

The operation has completed successfully. (`sudo blkid /dev/sdb` shows `PTTYPE="gpt"`)

With this out of the way, I'm going to reboot the system and see if the Windows installation media can put Windows 10 on that drive (or if it complains about seeing a different drive that already has Windows 10 on it, meaning that I would need to continue with the original plan to move the disk over to stuzzy first).
