# Playlist of songs that have tragically not been made yet

- mashup of I Want Candy with Walk Like An Egyptian
- Aria from *Gummi Bears: The Opera*
- Close To You, but without the creepy slurping noises
- [A parody of Uptown Funk about Spongebob Squarepants being a tampon](120b7848-7302-417a-932a-1f14e7593b4e.md)
- Smooth jazz cover of Solsbury Hill
- Ska cover of New York State of Mind
- A mashup of Lizzo's Juice with Aerosmith's Jaded
- The words Don't Stop Belivin' to the tune of Lionel Richie's "All Night Long"
- Luigi's Mansion theme, with Tom Nook Mart instrumentation (Luigi's Mart-sion)
- the Metroid theme using the sound palette of Tame Impala's "Elephant"
- a slow dark moody synth Pet Shop Boys cover of "You've Got to Get a Gimmick"?
- The "Mama's Talkin' Loud, Mama's Doing Fine" part of Rose's Turn, but on the piano in minor chords or whatever that make it sound like the Moonlight Sonata or otherwise creepy (like it could be Castlevania background music)

I think I might be getting some low-range AM interference on these headphones
