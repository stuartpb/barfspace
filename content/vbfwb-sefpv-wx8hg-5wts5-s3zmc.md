# Project Akira

This note has become the semantic nexus for recording the point in history where the scope of this repository started to explode.

The early stages are described at [how-i-roll's Tomb][]. From there, it expanded to an issue in Lean Notes, and that led to some thinking here.

Eventually, it became clear that most of my writing was going to get collected into this repository: how to structure this incoming work spontaneously developed as a one-off thought on [My Old Bad Ideas][], then was eventually brought to this page.

The gist of that content was later split off to its own page, which has developed into [Operation Trapper Keeper][OTK], the continuation of the work described here under the [Department of Barfspace](mfrzq-ch8r8-wj9a3-bdbdx-ffkc4).

The rest of this page tends to be kind of half-relevant: trying to deconstruct it so that this page can serve a clean historical function is part of Operation Trapper Keeper.

further thoughts on organic structure from here have moved to the [Oozy Sewer](6yanh-hg3gd-s69sp-wyba4-qgkgt)

[The Top-Level README Committee](nta2y-akyde-mq8s9-fcg9c-sqrrc), originally formed ahead of the greater merge, has been given its own page

## Thoughts on the Greater Barfspace

This is a quest-to-create-quests that's been grafted off of the Barfspace Operations stuff: it should be turned into the corresponding quest entries it describes for Barfspace Vision an Network Neighborhood.

I guess if this becomes notes.stuartpb.com, then you'd just call the general conceptual space of zero-filter self-oriented incidental-publishing (ie. using any platform in this fashion, not just bagtent, which can be used in other fashions) "Open Notes", like "the Open Notes movement"

- or maybe we'll call it XON, pronounced like "Exxon", for "*eXtreme* Open Notes" *(electric guitar, monster truck noises)*
- [ ] List this on the [Barfspace Vision Quest list][BVQL], with a cross-reference on the [Network Neighborhood quests arc][NetNQ]
  - [ ] Draft content in a quest on Visions.
  - [ ] Plan deployment by moving an action plan beyond content out as the "Selling Bagtent" quest being moved to a general Network Neighborhood movement quest.
