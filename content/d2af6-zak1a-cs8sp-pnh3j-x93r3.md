# The Lobby

Stuff that needs to be prepped in the lobby:

- The poster for The State
- The "Show ends in:" countdown sign to move into place
- The kilt hidden away somewhere
- The kiosk (should not just be stealable: possibly attached to the "Show ends in:" sign? Maybe they're the same thing? And people can tap the "I'm leaving early" button at any time except for the last five minutes? Maybe I even have an "I came late, what did I miss" button that plays a transcript of the show so far? That'd be a terrible idea, considering how much of this act is in the delivery.)

## Kiosk idea

Guests fill out the "I'm Leaving Early" form on a kiosk page that shows their face in the reflection, on camera, so they know what look is on their face superimposed as they read their own words. (I also take a picture of who wrote it, both to gauge if they're smug about it, and so I have warning if anybody decides this'd be a fun way to leave a death threat.)
