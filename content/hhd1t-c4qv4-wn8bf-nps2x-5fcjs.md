# Tavern of Meta in Total

This page is a loose nexus for all the "meta" stuff in these notes, especially relating to [the old barfspace][]:

- [the Academy of Barfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j) collects meta thoughts about these notes
- [The collection on "Worse is Better"](hp3rj-bp2vq-059k3-ge144-a3tcv) touches on one of the strongest themes underlying these notes' chaotic style / structure
- The hub that is currently conglomerating [History][]
- [How the repo tree is structured](ps8vc-ams0t-gx98e-wkt6f-42myq) is a Department of Engineering meta document from the [Notestack Core](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma)
- the old [Barfspace Visitor's Center][Visit]
- [Circa-December-2018 dumping space for thoughts on the name "barfspace" for the seed incarnation of this project][name explainer]
- [Twitter DM about this repo to Gravis][cera]
- [How I wrote before notes.stuartpb.com][how-i-roll writing.md]

When the old Barfspace tree was dissolved, I started the **[How I'm Writing with bagtent][HIWWB]** page to hold some of my initial thoughts on this, but I got distracted and *forgot* about that page's vital importance, so I'm really only catching up on some of those thoughts now.

## Not on barfspace but crucial to understanding the idea

- [Eventualism][] and really pretty much everything about how a site like Wikipedia functions (hint: the secret ingredient is anarchy)
