# One Word for Benjamin every year

A thing I've been thinking about is how great the "Plastics" line in The Graduate is, and how hard it is to convey what I can only describe as the "Thomas Friedman-ness" of it

NewsRadio in the nineties had a similar gag, where someone the station manager had been impressed with came on the air, and all he could say was "computers- they're the way of the future!"

like, it was a very clear trend, that would clearly be lasting, and it had certainly not reached its apogee,

Like, I feel like "mobile"... wouldn't even work for this at this point, since mobile has pronouncedly reached its saturation point. (also, there was never really any money in it unless you were one of the manufacturers.) But in 2015, recommending it to someone would have been hilarious.

I think "Deep Learning"... isn't *quite* there yet, because it's not quite omnipresent enough? But that's largely because it's an invisible technology...

Hahaha, maybe the word now is "Alexa". Because "speech recognition" isn't a word, but stupid people who think they're tech savvy think Alexa is a technology
