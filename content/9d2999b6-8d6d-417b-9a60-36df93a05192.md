# What's New in the Notes 2019-06-16: Mostly about refactoring

bringing back the Right Now node

gotta go fast, gotta cut this commit in case GitPod poofs

this should totally get tacked on to News, as well as the Academy (for its analysis) and Department (for its summation of plans that have coalesced and are being enacted without a clear Department link, this page probably due to become that institution)

The Breakout Brigade? the Breakout Brigade Builds Bars in every mission (hence all the Looking-for-Group Taverns)

Breaking Messays out into indices

Reintegrating Lean Notes a little bit

maybe doing the same kind of thing with Projects - there is a subheading about this there

repacking Quests in a... similar fashion to all this?

a thought to put into [The Organic Notegrowth Junction](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) (UPDATE: it's turned into just what this page is) is that live pathways work by refamiliarization... like desire paths, ant trails, rivers - at random points, but in a natural direction.

i think my point here is that sometimes a path dies, and is rediscovered - this might go into the note on lifecycle, that an index page dying can threaten a branch, and that may be fine because that whole branch has just become less relevant, like my projects for fixing Windows papercuts

but sometimes it can be because of a dumb unappealing or confusing placement, like I just lost my Tabalanche tabs for a while

(just added a note to the Right Now node that spawned this - spawn being an alternative to sprout namewise, now that I think about it - mentioning that the Notegrowth Streamlab is a big new hot item that just came out lately and is a forefront thing in the notes)

anyway, I just wanted to note how, like, in Projects, separating out a category that applies to *many or most* of the projects, like Web Apps, still opens avenues for further classification (like Productivity Apps versus whatever), by *resetting the root context to one where that coplanar axis for heading categorization is present*.

note that another trend that has emerged lately, these refactors being prominent examples, is blueprints being placed within pages they're supposed to

There's also the aspect where breaking out a page like this that was originally made just to coagulate links, I'm now feeling more free to just list things without making pages for them, like there's more room now that it's more specialized (ie. I'm mentioning project ideas I haven't made notes pages for before)
