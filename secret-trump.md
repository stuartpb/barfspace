# Ultimate Secret Trump

I'm wondering how this could be framed: I'm thinking, instead of Liberal and Fascist parties, since each character follows the "party platform" somewhat loosely (they can lose even when their team wins, and sometimes vice versa), the parties are Democrats and Republicans, the policies are Democratic and Capitalist (the Democrats, of course, have a party platform that believes in Democracy, but most of them also want to enable Capitalism at least a little bit), and the positions are President and CEO.

## New Feature: The Mueller Investigation

After each turn, the table votes (one vote per player) on three players to investigate the party membership of. The top three picks are investigated together, with all their cards being placed on the table (but no distinction of which card belonged to which player) and their memberships are returned to their original characters by the game moderator (Putin).

In other words, the Mueller investigation is thoroughly empowered to reveal the truth to players about general allegiances that they pretty much already knew about.

## Characters

Unlike classic Secret Hitler, each player has a role with dedicated details:

### Mooch (R)

No matter which Party ultimately wins, Mooch only wins by being Fired, so he can go off and build his brand (but, you know, he's not trying to suck his own dick about it).

### Manafort (R)

Manafort loses if the Republicans win (causing him to be indicted after the election), or if the Democrats win before every player at the table has been a candidate for President at least twice (giving Manafort enough time on the campaign trail to grift up a nest egg).

### Clinton (D)

Clinton only wins if the Liberals win after three Capitalist policies have been put down (making Donald Trump a real threat to the American people, presumably one strong enough to hand Hillary Clinton the vote by default).

### Trump (R)

While lots of Republicans win by getting Trump elected CEO, Trump himself can only win if he got to be *President* and enact at least one Fascist policy.

While this is a very difficult win condition, Donald Trump can always just ignore that he's actually lost, and tell himself he won.

### Bernie (D)

Bernie only wins if Democracy overtakes Capitalism - even if you told Donald Trump "You're Fired", that isn't enough to stop the rise of the billionaire class, the one percent of one percent.

(Considering that the win conditions of other Democrats generally involve either targeting Donald Trump or enabling Capitalism, this puts Bernie at odds with most of the other members of his team.)

### Schumer (D)

Chuck Schumer can only win if he's put down at least one Capitalist policy as President.

### Pelosi (D)

Nancy Pelosi can only win if she's put down at least one Capitalist policy as CEO.

### Jared (R)

Jared Kushner can only win if he's put down at least one Democratic policy as President.

### Ivanka (R)

Ivanka Trump can only win if she's put down at least one Democratic policy as CEO.

### Ryan (R)

Paul Ryan just plays by classic Republican strategy: wins if Capitalism overtakes Democracy or Donald Trump is elected CEO of America, loses if Democracy wins or if Donald Trump is Fired.

Like his Democratic counterpart in Bernie, since almost every other Republican is following some kind of compromised agenda (including Donald Trump, who *cannot* lowball his fascist allegiances like a traditional Hitler), Ryan's game can be more frustrating than anyone.

### Podesta (D)

John Podesta loses if any Democrat (or, in a 5 or 6 player game, the policy deck) is directly investigated (ie. not as a figure in the ongoing sprawl of the Muller Investigation, but as a Capitalist Power to investigate directly) by a Republican President who is not subsequently killed.

As Podesta does not know who the Republicans are (whether his fail condition was met under a Republican Presidency will not be revealed until the game is over), this means that he will be desparately looking to kill pretty much any President that disagreed with someone he believes to be a trustworthy ally: a particular asset for the Republicans, if Fascism can advance far enough. (Or, you know, Capitalism, Fire, those euphemisms.)

### Manchin (D)

Joe Manchin loses if he is ever on a ticket that enacts a Democratic policy, unless he votes "Yes" on the vote that elects Donald Trump CEO (in which case he wins with the Republicans).

### Stormy (D)

Stormy gets to know who Donald Trump is before anybody else: after the Republicans close their eyes and before Donald Trump puts his thumb up, Stormy gets to open her eyes and see the little thumb sticking up for a couple seconds.

Stormy Daniels only wins if Donald Trump never gets to pass a Fascist policy (as President or CEO), or is Fired.

### McConnell (R)

Mitch McConnell can only win if the Election Tracker stalls three times, causing a policy to be enacted off the top of the deck without a vote.

### Cohen (R)

If Michael Cohen is ever Investigated (either directly *or* as part of the Muller Investigation), his win conditions flip to those of the Democrats.

### Christie (R)

Chris Christie distinguishes himself to the other Republicans during the night phase with a middle finger.

After every turn, the Republicans take a secret vote on whether or not to keep Chris Christie. If the vote majority-fails (ie. more "No" votes than "Yes" votes), Chris Christie leaves the table immediately, and loses as if he were Fired.

### Franken (D)

Like Chris Christie, Al Franken reveals his identity after the night phase, and has a probationary presence at the table that all the players present vote on. As a Democrat, Franken reveals his identity to *all* players, and is voted on by Democrats and Republicans alike.

However, Franken does not get to vote on Elections, and if he is elected President or CEO, must discard his policy at random. Franken *does* get to see what policies he has been handed (and, if President when a Capitalist policy is enacted, gets to choose how to enact the policy), but they must be shuffled face-down by the other member of the ticket before he picks.

### Kelly (R)

John Kelly distinguishes himself to other Republicans during the night phase by pointing down at the table.

After each turn (after the vote on Chris Christie, if present), John Kelly can choose to swap one of his voting cards with any other Republican (he gets to pick which cards).

(To avoid exposing which players are Republicans when John Kelly is in play, all players must take care to not show more than one voting card face up.)

### Booker (D)

Cory Booker is subject to a running Bipartisanship Score, and can only win if he has more votes that agree with the players to his immediate left and right than *disagree* with the players to his left and right.

If the two players disagree on a vote, then the score does not change (as either way, Booker's vote agrees with one and disagrees with the other, cancelling each other out): however, if the two *agree*, Booker's Bipartisanship Score either goes up or down by 2, based on whether his vote matches theirs.

If the player to his left or right is eliminated, Booker's Bipartisanship Score now goes up or down by 1 *every turn*, based on whether or not his vote matches the remaining player on the other side.

If the player to Booker's immediate left *and* right are eliminated, Booker is finally free, and is no longer subject to this restriction (even if he'd voted against both of them every time, he can still win).
