This is a repository of works-in-progress and other not-ready-for-primetime writing that I do. I had previously kept a few of these as uncomitted files in my workspace for [stuartpb/meditations][] (not comitting them because I felt they weren't finished enough to publish), but eventually decided I'd rather maintain them in a perpetual work-in-progress repository.
