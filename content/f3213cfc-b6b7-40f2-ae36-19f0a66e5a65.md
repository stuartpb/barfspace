# a note on the "Open Editors" model I wish I had

(by which I mean the "Open Editors" lists in VS Code)

I wish I had a list of "open files" that, for the most part, closed the tabs when I commit to GitHub, and I can make a special choice for "keep this open even if there are no uncommitted changes"

This model could be extended to a "draft commit" model for non-code-server editor interfaces

## another implication from this

I'd love to switch between open sets of editors based on which Git branch I have open - especially which tabs I want "pinned"

Rather, I want this for stashing changes like branches. Really, I want to be able to jump between draft changesets, and merge as I write
