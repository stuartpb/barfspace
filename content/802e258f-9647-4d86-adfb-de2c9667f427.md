# dataturf

ideas leading into this:

- [Squorum](80c01468-5a12-4496-90f0-64abad259156.md)
- [Arbitrary byte visualizer / hex editor](68bb497c-899f-45a5-8053-20d12a8b470b.md)
- [Casettic](d948aa6b-15a3-481e-a989-abae66d8ee9f.md)
- [a transitional attempt to rethink Squorum](b8ae3b52-4c57-4ffc-8234-86f4ec7c739a.md)

maybe there just need to be two ideas, Deep Zoom Squorum and 2D Casettic

okay, so, this can work just like Reddit's canvas thing, but it's a little more complex now: each block of land represents one byte of claimed data, but you're allowed to convert that data to whatever presentation you want

so I guess this'd be a 2^64 a side square, give it the same address space as Casettic but make it so...

oh man, what if you have a *discount* for ley lines. or something like that that could induce Casettic-style data reclamation

also, the idea here is that the data layer is separate from a "shield" layer - you put your data in

so could shield layer allow overlaps? maybe some shields adapt when overlapped (ie. just take less power and cede the area), and some, you know, all the stuff I described

oh, so, like, it's overlapping presentationally, but it needs to break the other shield to be able to capture and claim its data? and that's how attacks work? hmm, this is a thing casettic lacked, a way to really represent what your spot on the tape was

anyway a shield can only access data it covers

oh man, what if shields actually break other shields claims using code executing...

ugh at this point you just have to say "on the Ethereum network" and now it's a gross cryptocurrency thing, I don't want this to live in the same planet as electric proof of work

this is totally a Smugglers Cove idea

so a property of shields is that they convert the 2d area to a 1d address space according to some rule that will be able to adapt to losing space if the shield shrinks (same goes for whatever filesystem

so, in other words, the addressing pattern determines the direction the shield will shrink in as it is attacked

the data is virtualized into presentation forms like images

haha the resource can be Exposure. Maybe client access actually generates resources

ooh, that's an interesting way to organically set up "energy transfers" - ooh, maybe shields can opt to install/display Portals

shields can display hyperlinks/pointers

anyway as shields shrink, they lose control and access to the data they were

oh man, Closeness of Address to the Current Date... there ought to be a line in the address space for each axis showing "today"

and then those corners are prime real estate, in an already high-price

and maybe there could be a way to access the bits of the current date in another address space? you could even waste 2/5 of your bits on encoding the date as decimal after a prefix

if you include a time, you have 4 bits left over

though you can use that for the last digit letter since the first one won't ever be above 16

I wonder if numeric addresses like this will become sensible real estate. hey, is this maybe a format that could enable Timetress?

one thing I'm thinking is that "the center is the origin", but I don't know about an addressing model where all the evens are on one side and all the odds are on another to count up

but, you know what? I like the way that signed coordinates make very-high addresses valuable, too. so that works out.

heh, and the centers become corners if you want to view The Limits in Unsigned Mode

that might be a thing: no crossing the origin.

or, heck, at this point, just make it unsigned, and whatever noise was going on about how the edge would be structured now applies to the center.

maybe there's a linear Edge Force, and a circular Center Force, and they interact somehow. like you can't really maintain more than a four-byte "color" shield

how about also a diagonal Corner Force for closely-symmetrical addresses

ohh snap, maybe that's what goes in the blocks, WASM code to drive the shield in a "boot sector" that also knows how to interact with other data under the shield

hotness of bytes... okay, so maybe shields reserve quartets, that's better for modern processors anyway. And the way data decays is that the fourth byte ticks down...

hmm, nah. I think it's just a matter of each byte slowly reducing to zero, so it fades to black and alpha (I'm thinking the background can be some sort of starfield generated by nearby shields harvesting Exposure)

haha oh wow okay so, computing power is dedicated to running the WASM, but all it can compute is how to interface with the API presented by the shield, which is like, "ask to do thing on behalf of the user"

this can be structured in a way

and so this is why so many shields are simple display-all-underlying-blocks-as-pixels type machines - they're an alternative to the much more flexible WASM device that has a much higher energy cost

the idea I'm having is that... okay so these devices would be like the NeoPixels of the 2d space - no board taking up space to drive it (ie. no frame)

but, okay, you'd pair it with a more complicated device that could draw on the blocks, and that'd have a frame. and then you could pay a Device Transition (ensuring you don't have to release the space, in which time a standing Bid Sniper you didn't know about might capture the space

oh man could Idle Service Workers form a mesh for this stuff, I mentioned that this would take client processing power to run these machines

so machines with network capability (like snipers) can only do things for the logged in user, to avoid crypto miners

## more thoughts about the WASM / boot block thing

you can make it so they're magic-numbered, based on a search for patterns in an order of precedence from all the locations a bootblock can be initialized at

also I'm thinking there can be a "real data" layer (which does have quartets, every byte of which fades out when a block begins to "decay" - once the alpha byte hits 0, the whole quartet dies)

time held if the Claim is broken is governed by the alpha of the "presentation" layer (which is always presented as opaque), which can be transformed to values other than the underlying quartet by Magic Color Configurations within a claim

the Magic Pattern declares how to map the 2D space into 1d data structures

maybe you have to draw the magic letters "W A S M" with alphas of 0 in the configuration of the first four corners - putting them in the corners of the claim will make an inward spiral

wait that doesn't make any sense. what would make sense would be, like, a series of three-letter-words as RGB values with 0 alpha, place those magic pixels in an image and it'll be interpreted as a magic block, with whatever kind of

oh man, you could make the WASM for processing, itself, secret, with some kind of generic encryption mechanism

oh right, no, okay, forget the 1:1 raster layer idea, the whole point of this was so that a block could contain a much-higher-res PNG than its natural bitmap

so maybe that's a feature of the WASM interface, you can get a double-pixel resolution display (enough for 1 pixel per byte), or quad-pixel or octuple-pixel (enough for a good byte-for-byte hex editor view, you could have each nibble be a 3x6 character)

haha, oh man you could keep UIs from getting too good by making it so buttons must be arranged as sub-claims
