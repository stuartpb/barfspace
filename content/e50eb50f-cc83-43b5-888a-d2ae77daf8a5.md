# The Shadow Curtain

This is meant to be the page tracking and alluding to repositories of content that is kept foreign to these notes.

[BISNES/BIGDOG](bfdafa43-6389-46c1-a308-8e6cc68bf0a3.md) and [Federating Bagtent](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md) both explore the concept of tooling for Random Markdown Graphs that may need to interoperate with different levels of confidentiality

It crosscuts a lot of [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) concerns

## rehosted note from Loose Notes

blackbeard's treasure public/private/secret three-layer personal disclosure classification model?

heck even just describing what a Blackbeard's Treasure gambit is would be cool

On this note, these linked pages should consider having a "confidential but not encrypted" host, versus a host/toolchain for encrypted database(s) that could be kept in secret locations (this might be a job for secure scuttlebutt? maybe not necessary for one user)

## Implementation

The rest of this page is working with [The Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) to figure out how these priorities intersect with the Outstanding Challenges there

## Brainstorming "quest"

Taken from the only Barfspace Quest that was moved to the Operations page (the one where the Divisions are listed now) and not later rearranged to be under [Operation Trapper Keeper](1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md):

- [ ] Set up a private bagtent tree for notes that should remain unpublished and private.
  - [ ] Figure out what'd be an appropriate way to distribute this.
    - [ ] Keep a master repository in an encrypted repo on a USB stick on your router-server?
      - [ ] Complete the "Flash Open-Source Router Firmware" quest (which I don't think I've written up yet) to unlock this path.
    - [ ] Keep it on your desktop, and just try to keep it booted into Linux forever?
      - [ ] Unlock the "Booting Stutendo Under Stushiba" tech to make this a more feasible idea.

## More thoughts on keeping a private repo synced

[Mostly by running a Git server or something like that on a Raspberry Pi](8a752277-0d93-426d-aa5f-d799cce7be45.md)
