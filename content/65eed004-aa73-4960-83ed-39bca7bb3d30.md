# Setting Up My Pwnagotchi

image downloaded, not yet flashed. still waiting for the Pi to show up

reminder here that I'm thinking about getting a Raspberry Pi A to replace the Zero in my Prusa MK3S, which I could desolder and use as a Pwnagotchi if the package with the Zero gets lost or whatever

## anyway, the new zeroes are here
