# The Rest

- [the-thing-about-weird-twittering.md][]
- [waxhead-revisited.md][]
- [unlinkable.md][]
- [knowing-where-we-have-been.md][], which I don't remember what it was supposed to contain, but I think it was about the importance of keeping history? Anyway, that was the joke of originally committing it, and now that it doesn't have a filename it's even more confusing and should really just get dropped in the next commit
