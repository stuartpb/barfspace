# On strings in Understanding Lua

Note from OneNote:

> - Strings: big solid cards with the contents of the string on them
>   - Cards have a [===[ pattern on the top and ]===] pattern on the bottom

I no longer believe this is the best representation of strings (it was echoed in Trello as "Strings are cards with the string written on them"): the one described in the current draft, where strings are strands of tape, is better.

*EDITORS NOTE 2019-06-08: I think I probably forgot to write down that this was the plan for the draft: I don't see any other description of this idea, though it makes enough sense that I think I can work with it*
