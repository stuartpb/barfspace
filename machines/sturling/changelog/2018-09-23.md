# 2018-09-23: changing chips

I've decided to move sturling to the storage I removed from stuzzy so I can use this M.2 stick for another project.

I've plugged both enclosures into stuzzy, and am working from there.

Since it looks like GParted can't just migrate the entire GPT over, I'm going to shrink the root Linux partition to as small as possible, then `dd` all the space I can over to the new drive, then (after confirming the new device works) wipe the old disk and start installing the new system I intend to use it for.

Having resized the partition to its smallest in GParted, I'm trying `sudo dd if=/dev/sdc of=/dev/sdb bs=8192 count=1954827 conv=sync status=progress`

## QEMU

While this goes, I'm going to try setting up QEMU on stuzzy to boot from these drives without having to actually power down.

Oh, apparently I've already got it installed. Wait, what? `pacman -Qi qemu` says it's required by gnome-boxes, which another `-Qi` tells me I explicitly installed August 30. I guess it got installed as part of the `gnome` base? `pacman -Qg gnome` tells me, oh snap, it was, nice.

Okay, opening up Boxes.

It doesn't seem to have a way to not start with a file or existing VM, so I'm going ahead and telling it to set up a new machine with https://d3g5gsiof5omrk.cloudfront.net/nixos/18.03/nixos-18.03.133245.d16a7abceb7/nixos-graphical-18.03.133245.d16a7abceb7-x86_64-linux.iso

### Well, that was a huge mistake

It appears that gnome-boxes, when you give it the name of an image to download, will download it into **RAM** - this caused everything on the system to halt and die (since I still haven't set up swap on stuzzy), including the `dd` I was running earlier.

However, it still got far enough to copy all the partitions (since I'd shrunk the root), so (after rebooting, as gnome-shell had decided to take ownership of basically all the RAM on the system) I went ahead and tried to open it in GParted, which didn't work.

## Recovering the now-corrupt GPT

Here's the entire process (including repeated help invocations, because I'm dumb and lazy) I used to fix the GPT after moving the content:

```
[stuart@stuzzy ~]$ sudo gdisk /dev/sdb
GPT fdisk (gdisk) version 1.0.4

Warning! Disk size is smaller than the main header indicates! Loading
secondary header from the last sector of the disk! You should use 'v' to
verify disk integrity, and perhaps options on the experts' menu to repair
the disk.
Warning! Main and backup partition tables differ! Use the 'c' and 'e' options
on the recovery & transformation menu to examine the two tables.

Warning! One or more CRCs don't match. You should repair the disk!
Main header: OK
Backup header: OK
Main partition table: OK
Backup partition table: ERROR

Partition table scan:
  MBR: protective
  BSD: not present
  APM: not present
  GPT: damaged

****************************************************************************
Caution: Found protective or hybrid MBR and corrupt GPT. Using GPT, but disk
verification and recovery are STRONGLY recommended.
****************************************************************************

Command (? for help): v

Caution: The CRC for the backup partition table is invalid. This table may
be corrupt. This program will automatically create a new backup partition
table when you save your partitions.

Problem: main GPT header's backup LBA pointer (62533295) doesn't
match the backup GPT header's current LBA pointer (31277231).
The 'e' option on the experts' menu may fix this problem.

Problem: main GPT header's last usable LBA pointer (62533262) doesn't
match the backup GPT header's last usable LBA pointer (31277198)
The 'e' option on the experts' menu can probably fix this problem.

Problem: main header's disk GUID (537F37D1-BFCD-DA49-A444-1D37E430384C) doesn't
match the backup GPT header's disk GUID (314F0DC1-7BDB-45FE-B6FF-A7D6F4506D3F)
You should use the 'b' or 'd' option on the recovery & transformation menu to
select one or the other header.

Problem: Disk is too small to hold all the data!
(Disk size is 31277232 sectors, needs to be 62533296 sectors.)
The 'e' option on the experts' menu may fix this problem.

Problem: GPT claims the disk is larger than it is! (Claimed last usable
sector is 62533262, but backup header is at
62533295 and disk size is 31277232 sectors.
The 'e' option on the experts' menu will probably fix this problem

Partition(s) in the protective MBR are too big for the disk! Creating a
fresh protective or hybrid MBR is recommended.

Final checks complete. About to write GPT data. THIS WILL OVERWRITE EXISTING
PARTITIONS!!

Do you want to proceed? (Y/N): y
OK; writing new GUID partition table (GPT) to /dev/sdb.
The operation has completed successfully.
```

## re-inflating

Now that the GPT is OK, I go back into GParted and expand the partition on the new sturling disk.

On the old one... I don't know, I'm going to see what NixOS wants to do. Whatever I do from here, it'll be documented in the changelog for stuzzy, not sturling.
