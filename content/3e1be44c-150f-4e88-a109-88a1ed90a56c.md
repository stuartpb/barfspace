# Knowing Where We Have Been

I created a file with this name on 2018-04-15 back when barfspace was a flat tree of named files, but it was empty until 2018-09-18, when I filled in a comment about not knowing where the file's content had been. Since I had the workspace it was in set to auto-save, it would seem that I never got around to writing anything in that file.

This is one of the reasons I'm designing the new shotclock system for barfspace to have a mechanism that prevents me from spawning files created with no context (designing systems for creating files off of a new or unlinked reference, and/or refusing to commit when there are files without inbound links).

My original thinking was that this was probably going to be something like what I eventually wrote in one of the other files in this repo, but I'm not sure which, so I'm going to start using this as a sort of "topic index" for the general globular cluster around "things that get me thinking about history and presence of mind":

- [News is History][]
- [Squashing the Deltas][]
- The [Clusterhood][] spitballing document kind of touches on the theme of "you have to show your work"
- Have I written anything about petlogs? This is a big part of how petlogs are useful
