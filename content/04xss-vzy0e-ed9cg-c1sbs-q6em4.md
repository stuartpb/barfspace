# Talkboy Wand / App

have I written about the Talkbox idea I had for the old Google AI Voice Kit? well, I was thinking "that's dumb, it's less practical than an app"

so that got me thinking, what'd be *more* practical than an app? And then it hit me: a "magic wand" SKU, where you could design "personalities" and it'd have buttons and lights and a microphone and gyro and all that

you could maybe have "buttons" on either side, and also squeeze sensors; how feasible would microhaptics to simulate "clicking" be here? maybe it's lights on one axis and touch strips along the other?

Oh man, a "drumstick mode", where you

Oh snap, what if you touch your finger to the tip where there's a fingerprint reader, and the wand either only accepts you as a master, or

Aw hell, can this be modular to assemble longer wands?

Oh, you know what'd be best? a simple USB-C butt, and you can add extensions with that. Hell, you could even let the Microphone be an extension - let it be the Smart Mic

Oh yeah, letting the Coral connect directly to an Arduino or something for voice recognition would be *incredible*. In any case, you can use a USB-C port to connect the wand to beefier peripherals

## real easy hardware

this is a cool way to experiment with buttons and a gyro: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07QDY6BHD/

see [Functions for a B Key](8dnzc-xxbaw-g18zm-66z62-ee1re)

definitely something to consider in tandem with a Raspberry Pi that has a speaker

## increasingly fancy hardware

OK, so, doesn't the Yubikey have some kind of miniaturized fingerprint reader

one idea I think would be incredible that would almost certainly be materially prohibitive, but super cool, would be to have a layer between each LED that can switch between translucent and opaque, and use that to toggle between distinct regions

honestly you could probably get the usability benefits of this by just increasing the LED resolution

## no, but, seriously

This could be a neat interface for...

okay, so, say you have a "tape recorder" app. The recording starts at a given color, and then cycles through the spectrum once an hour (or once a minute - whatever scope you're at).

You can swipe along the one side to scrub and insert and redact and all that, using buttons on the other side

Maybe you can even make it a triangular prism, so there are three clear sides - that also makes the "rainbow" aspect more sensical

Another thing that might be a sensible extension would be to let it work as a pen/stylus - and you could include the "optical mouse" parts to make that work "on the table", for when you need more precision than the gyro (or is it?)

if it'd be possible to make the laser mouse also work as a laser pointer, that'd be really cool

Okay, so... you know what, that seems niche enough that - weren't we saying this would have a USB-C port on the end? And I was like "oh, the other end should be a touchpad / fingerprint reader"?

Put a USB-C port on both ends, and allow for all these "end things" to be extensions. (You can even let one end be an outie in a recessed enclosure, for stability - but that's probably too complicated)

Or rather, I'm thinking the right thing to do would be to have the kit ship with "caps" for fingerprint recognition and magnetic charging...

maybe you can have the magnetic charger be in-line? mag-safe?

is it possible for this to recharge via induction?

you could have a pair of pieces that lets this pair to a PC as a conventional "presenter remote" with a 2.4GHz USB-A wireless dongle
