# mutation frenzy

(I don't know that there's a distinct page for this yet - I think it's more of a "Department/Academy of Barfspace catalogs snapshots from this section, or a page like it, on a regular basis" thing)

I just accidentally conjured a new page, so, [right now for the notes here](9d2999b6-8d6d-417b-9a60-36df93a05192.md)

note that should get updated like I meant to do that, to categorize the refactors that are happening in the notes in a way suitable to form an institution

as that ended up turning into a big mass that I may have not given its own page - or as that page ended up going too much into one subject to fill a broader duty of encapsulating all that's going on in these notes (a form of mutation in creation that happens sometimes) - I'm going to summarize here (another form of note mutation that would get explored on the following page) that [this page about specific observed phenomena in the notes](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) is *hella trending for me right now, yo*

I'm even considering giving it a proper name, all institution-like!

That's been a trend going on lately, lots of reshuffles around the Department of Barfspace (which might get renamed), lots of new task forces and subgroups being formed to handle different duties, lots of old pages of stuff like Quests or notes on a thing in these notes getting reframed as standing forces to collect and implement that thing, lots of new jurisdictions springing up

Weird Stubs being another prospective institution (maybe that should become a subsection of the org chart page? Or the content of the org chart, to be an incubator, and the established players live on the root?)

Mutation Notegrowth thought: This is a not-that-bad way to create a hierarchy: more-traveled pages live one page up. You can Graduate like that. But then there's the matter of, do you allow notes to fall back, how do you adapt out decreases in traffic, explore this.

the [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) getting split out to track tech/vertical implementation work is one of the more prominent changes, though the [Academy of Barfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md), as parent to the previously-mentioned introscpection, is coming along

[bagtent's root note](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) is finally getting some respect, too

I imported Petlogs, been using those a bit

History is shaping up a bit

Did I already write the thing about blueprints at notes for improvements to the notes, that can be used as the next iteration of the notes once their links have beeen filled out? that should get merged into the "right now for the notes here" page I made above either way, I'm tired, I need to cut this commit and sleep
