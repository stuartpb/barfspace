## Related

- the [Ops in a Box](0dehw-8kxsa-81amj-gp4kk-td8cw) project describes the vision that originally drove Plushu, which is now its own thing at a few levels that would most likely not use Plushu much, if at all
- [Gitolite](cw5f4-gxafp-e0ayc-70sgf-8yj8x) is still around - would be cool to redesign Plushu in a way that would work well with that?

## to pull from

[kubernetes note on images](0rrck-8xa2r-avakd-n4wm3-j26ry) has a section that applies here, might make sense merged into one of the divergences in the brainstorming group
