# Series of writeups on my crypto components

or whatever you'd call them.

The narrative order I'm thinking would make sense:

- Hashblot
- [OPWS](2h7ch-fepsd-xqamr-3j43v-dbd8j)
- NilPass
- Surpass (especially Gross Simplification)
- Hashsplat
- Alphabinary

## What for?

This could lead into a Technical Content application to [Mozilla](1pm8s-6x03w-r39gt-0and3-tx2ww).

This could also onboard people to the [Hall of Champions](t0qv3-yszzz-40a4v-5zgbk-f43j6).

- Note that this intersects thoughts from [stuartpb On Security](9qb42-94e42-81ans-2rerv-1nq45)
  - [Dream Identity Management System](7xr1k-yvmxb-f9bzc-9sgqg-bf542) in particular
  - this would be an entry on [Accouch](3bgmz-ptkas-baa2b-w9a4z-kmm7f) if I'd written it
  - maybe it can be split into smaller thoughts?
  - IDK, just stuff to consider
