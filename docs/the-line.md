meditations got so bad because it rapidly (well, on subsequent revisits), well, turned into a blog. once I removed the "spec" part of it - I meant to make it about broader engineering in a way that'd be reflective of life, but instead I just started talking about life in a way that'd maybe be applicable to engineering.

and I guess that's somewhat unavoidable

but not, like, absolutely unavoidable

like it can be... limited, boomed, I mean that's why I made this repo, to let meditations not go completely to shit, but now it's like, where do I draw that line, where do I say "this is too tendril-y, too hairy and too personal", in a way that doesn't make me go "I have to follow too many rules to write on that, I'll just do (next easiest thing, which if I put rules on all my writing turns into "browse Reddit, eat junk food, and nap")

which by the way, that's totally a thing, folks never getting shit done because they set the bar for quality WAY too high, and so they never are okay doing the early stuff that'd get their experience up
