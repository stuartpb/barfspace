# bagtent

This is an index page for pages that talk about bagtent, ie. the tooling and structure of these notes

## Pages that talk about bagtent

- [The original Lean Notes README][Lean Notes] has some notes on how bagtent is that should probably get moved to a proper schema page
- [the old content of this page][barfbarf] could be divvied up into a bunch of subpages (it's huge), but figuring out how to recap the context around each thing is tricky enough that I can't handle it right now
- [Barfspace Implementation and Tooling Quests][BIT]
