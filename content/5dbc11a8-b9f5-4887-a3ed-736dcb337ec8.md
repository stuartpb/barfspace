# Anime Random Identifiers

I was thinking about how you could pair proquints with a wordlist

like "Super Dimension Macross" or "Magical Girl Hatena"

Hmm, if you only did 3 syllables - 4 consonants - you'd have 22 bytes (or 18 without the last consontant), meaning you'd need 10 (12) more bits for 32-bit

You could probably do wordlists for those in alphabi!
