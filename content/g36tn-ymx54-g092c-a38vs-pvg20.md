# Static-Site-Hosting Helmbag(s)

## Content host suite

- A nice pipeline for static pages
  - What about netlify cms?
- PeerTube, but maybe not openly federating
  - Maybe some of the Distributed Suite as well?

This overlaps into [Plain Old File-Friendliness Helm Bags](hbn7h-zmwqr-m4aaz-zd6xb-f8y0d)
