# how-i-roll historically

This was another, similar project to [Lean Notes][], but with more of an eye toward describing my own *specific* procedures I follow when setting out to do things. It contained three significant files, all of which fall under the category of "[Stuff I Do in my Projects on GitHub][]" (where the non-Manual-of-Style content lives today).

[Lean Notes]:y063t-8w892-wm8ty-pg17v-k8gwm
[Stuff I Do in my Projects on GitHub]: krj3r-7ac6y-w99v9-f6x54-zjrrx

Everything but the Manual of Style (pending a merger into these notes as part of OpTrapKeep) is listed on that page. Today, both the "writing" and the "issues" pages are historical artifacts, since I primarily use these notes now.

Historically, it was in revisiting this repo that [I originally hatched the bagtent project structure](https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/issues/3): other than that, this is most likely just a historical curiositiy that will eventually be ironed out of the tree and dissolved as its original content gets reappropriated, refactored, and revised (see the premise of the repo deteriorating over the course of that issue reconsidering other projects).

## peek ahead

Since the Strike Force below is assembling here to gather pre-historical notes, [here][LN-issue-1] is the original idea for how I was going to structure Lean Notes: it should probaby be used as a basis for all of Lean Notes' pre-bagtent history in some future commit's refactoring.

## Reflection on how this repo got integrated

Everything but the Manual of Style (pending a merger into these notes as part of OpTrapKeep) is listed on the page [Stuff I Do in my Projects on GitHub][]. Today, both the "writing" and the "issues" pages are historical artifacts, since I primarily use these notes now.

(They do a fair job of describing how I *used* to roll, though, which I think is why I want to document how I roll *now* so much in [Barfspace Operations][]' quests, because having obsolete docs as historical artifacts goes a long way to understanding old documentation structure - it's like an old driver being available to interface to a legacy device through an emulation/compatibility layer.)

## PLAN: Strike Team Archaeology Force Alpha

This is an adjunct [Department of Barfspace][DoB] task force specifically for gathering and assembling historical artifacts

[DoB]: xcf83-y2s77-w59jc-21g12-032mn

We can repurpose "Stuff I Do In my Projects on GitHub" as a hub for "How I Rolled Before These Notes", and move the Starting a Repo note into Lean Notes (and make sure it's listed here, as well as the other items listed there, as that page can expand to incorporate other memories)

### old note about history

EXAMPLE, 2019-05-28: As far as I know, there's *still* no "oral history" page explaining my best recollection of the meditations -> barfspace / Lean Notes / how-i-roll -> notes.stuartpb.com trajectory. the [old smaller Barfspace root][OBR], and the history page linked there, kind of come close, but they don't continue to explain the merge well enough. in fact, now that I reread it, I can see that that page is currently stashing a few more links to the past artifacts... maybe that'll just be what that page goes on to be, a "museum"

but, argh, I guess what it is is that... argh. I keep going "oh, it can be where I jot down loose memories to explain things I started doing!" but, like, the thing is... these notes are self-hosting now, I do it live, there will never be another artifact like that one, they'll all be in journal form now

anything that notes the repo history will need to list that there was a second Great Uncertainty when I went to the destructuring because the interconnected markdown was more complicated and I didn't want to commit broken Markdown - that ended up being kind of a lost cause, but nonetheless we march forward

## Artifact collection

- [Lean Notes and Linkdumps](3kahy-e5jvy-d59kb-dncad-k10wg), an artifact that spawned the original Project Akira standalone page (I think?)
- [Smuggler's Cove](b39ge-ag6e2-y39vc-qwm8a-cmwmy) has a historical detail to pick off

## Old thoughts in node

- [News is History](7sngb-gkwtw-53b2v-snx0e-88hsr) covers some stuff from the early days of the News page

Maybe these historical thoughts can be merged into something here, like so much of the stuff in the Worse is Better page that's an artifact from the filenames days of barfspace?

## Bridge to Camp Papalima

It's also probably worth describing the former structure of Petlogs that was just merged in here

### possibly a new subcamp

(I don't think there's a page about this IIRC)

And, heck, why not describe the original "see X issue page" structure of the half-started Understanding Lua draft repo? And a little more detail about its Trello / OneNote / imaginary images walking around in Redmond historical phases, which would also explain Dashseat (so maybe that'd be the page to hold this).
