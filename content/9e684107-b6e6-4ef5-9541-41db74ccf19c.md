# Studtop Mk 2 Plans/Exploration

TODO: fish still-relevant plans out from [the first iteration](9ac503ed-a6d8-4fc3-996b-d1e94d18e139.md)

## Already implemented

- [the Phase-2 Framework: Recovery-First](97191518-e7e9-4a55-9962-69b7b6399f5b.md)
  - the recovery side is kind of crap, but I can work on it later if I care to
    - I'm kind of going to be looking into this anyway to bring Stuzzy back up
      - just bought a new 64GB MicroSD card and some USB drives to make a SuperPenguin, the many-in-one ISO booting stick

## Goals after this step

My first changes would all be in the service of reaching a remake of [the Iteration-1 Notestack Household Workspace](67826054-ed26-41e6-80c9-5d677e6a8cba.md)

Following procedures (with the benefit of hindsight) from [when I originally set this up on K3OS](9af1ee19-ac0a-46e1-8a9c-d6815a455f4f.md)

- kubeapps
  - I'll see how close I can get to installing each of the rest of these as Helm charts
- metallb
- kubernetes-dashboard
- household-system/household-dns

[Following the Rebuilding Plan](2d2421e6-4ef4-4a37-aaa8-bd6fa0f81a0d.md)

## okay, so, what comes next, just after midnight 2020-06-13

here's the plan for my Saturday:

- Longhorn - I want to be able to set this next stuff up with storage available.
- Rebuild household-dns
- Maybe authentication soon, for the Dashboard in particular
  - Would also be useful for this next step with Grafana
- Prometheus Operator, Loki et al. Especially since I'm punting on metrics-server right now: I need to know if I'm making things cramped.
- then a notes workspace again

## Real future goals

- [I Should Have a Proper "Contacting" Page](601fb0d1-b15d-4cb7-808d-36c96aaec7f6.md)
- A Grafana / Today's Weather etc screen (a Hollywood Computer for cluster stats)
