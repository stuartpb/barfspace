# The Museum of Notegraph History

This is the branch of the [Notegraph Historium](rjnhy-tyar8-05aw9-svgbr-akn86) which collects artifacts and links to where they were pulled from, and weaves into some of the other studies from the [Academy of Belfspace](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j)

See also [Stuart P. Bentley's Content Through the Ages](v8rhb-279v2-mp8k3-v3jd5-wr08h) for records describing precents from *outside* these notes

## Notable historical locations

- [Quests](dwjwz-5wex1-ge9ve-1w4ge-avg0g), where my original active planning in these notes started, has since become obsolete
- [the original bagtent braindump](jgsdh-qj8br-mk8vj-z8xmy-xmhgs)
  - collects the line of thoughts that were spit out in what would eventually become the more-robust [bagtent index](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3)

## Artifacts and stuff like that

- [On Right Now, News, and Quests](3nrbf-n69bk-qga59-e1z55-fsa0v)
  - reflections on three ways of presenting state that eventually became an obsolete concern
- [News for March to May of 2019](sa167-p707d-4hade-dzqhy-j8c8z)
  - This was an older way of looking at the notes's development without trying to split by subject
  - It led to things being forgotten a lot
  - This is why News is being deprecated
- [The Inline Rock](t2m2g-73fjy-r58h9-406ky-mz9re)
  - The mark that led me to inline all Markdown links I encountered.

## Historical Reflections and Documentation

- [Footlinks for Searching](h3jma-ap4ef-01a3j-hfdjq-d31jq), a look back at what inspired the pre-inlining approach

## Modern pages

These, of course, are liable to turn from News to History at any time

This really ought to be a project of the [Academy](n30v4-dw8dc-c98hz-wyaay-1vf8j), with maybe a link under the Department that it should review these observations when charting new pathways

- [The Right Near Outpost](vqf81-6650g-8ka3r-k582q-b2vnh)
  - the pipeline from Journals to Lean Notes
- [Journalling and Checking In](eh2kt-jgmeh-yqag4-yc777-qef0c)
  - stuff like Right Now and Petlogs
- [How I'm Editing These Notes (Late 2019)](vy0yt-f4gh2-rx8q3-a604p-en6wm)
  - A snapshot of the notestack in action

the [Beyonder Consulate](w72r2-yzcwa-01a5f-1fwvr-85ay7) tracks other constructions that are currently maintained outside the notes
