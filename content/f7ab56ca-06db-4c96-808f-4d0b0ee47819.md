## going through the Concepts pages

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#addons oh okay, here's a thing I've been wondering that explains some stuff

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/#how-to-change-ownership-of-a-field-between-the-configuration-file-and-direct-imperative-writers all these instructions that are "to switch from one method to the other, stop using it like that" are clearing my pores

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/kustomization/ I think this is a little too deep for me before I read the other concept documentation? I was able to get pretty much everything up to this point, but this seems to get weedier and weedier to appreciate

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/#defining-controller-selectors-and-podtemplate-labels I don't understand how this is connected to declarative config?
