# Themes

These are pages that stand for ideas that I can best/only express by collecting links (internal or external) to things that go into a facet or sibling of the idea

- [Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md)
- [Ruinous Reification](7aecb2c6-18e8-4967-9447-e743ebc003ec.md)

## Jailer's Cays

These are an odd series of notes with a similar "vibe" that I can't quite define beyond a generally Spider-Skull-Island type theme

- [Security Island](4dd64124-8e20-4901-aae4-5876361adc85.md)
- [Smuggler's Cove](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md)
- [Anarchy Headquarters](c47c2afa-59e0-4cde-a5b5-6afe4509ac46.md)
- [Signatory Conclave](64a52921-8c92-40bb-a0e5-16414cc96d18.md)

there should really be a division that's like "The Exploration of Outer Address Space" between Smuggler's Cove and the next two

- [Okay, But Seriously, Base32 Address Space](c525b73d-c310-485e-bd33-1c321a4e0364.md)
