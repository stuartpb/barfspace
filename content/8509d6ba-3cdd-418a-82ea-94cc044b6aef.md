# Project Idea Incubator

This is *far* from a comprehensive list of all my project ideas: *that* list is up on https://unusual.studio/projects.

However, sometimes that page needs a place to reference project ideas, and sometimes, those project ideas live in these notes. (At some point, these notes will probably get a special kind of link there, like what I think "Info" currently has.)

It's important to note that the UUIDs used *here* have no relation to the UUIDs used elsewhere (ie. for reference in Unusual Studio) - a UUID refers either to a project listing there, or a document here. Any project that's listed both here *and* there is going to have two separate UUIDs, [and that's the way it should be](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/8).

Here are some pages that collect recurring classes or "themes" of projects I get ideas for or an interest in (for comparing and contrasting the ideas) - they're not exclusive, but all the projects in these notes should be linked off at least one of them:

## Web-compatible ideas

- [Collective Content Containers](3a393a7f-58e0-41de-aef9-267b2f911f95.md)
  - ie. ideas for forums and wikis using non-conventional post/article formats
- [Content Editor Ideas](52a91c72-061a-4d6f-8018-b3e86351c0d5.md), stuff like IDEs
- [Frameworks and Scaffolds](d78bdabf-6401-489e-a284-51c500826748.md)
- [Components, Features, and Parts](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md)
- [Infrastructure Projects](bbd1dca8-d599-45c1-8f08-adc37d8a76ec.md)
- [Spec ideas](623663c5-9130-48ca-a3a7-1a37e88d307a.md)
- [Browser Extensions](55f979e1-71e9-40db-aad2-34418ec7bb5d.md)
- [Non-Web-Platform Software Projects](4b0818d9-18a3-4c2d-8845-e5092fe91d52.md)
  - Complemented by [this reframing of everything on this page in web-stack terms](d93f66b1-427e-4978-8ac7-14fb452bfad6.md)

## A different dimension

- [Security node](4dd64124-8e20-4901-aae4-5876361adc85.md) should start collecting security-adjacent projects
- [Smuggler's Cove](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md) is right next door to that

## More-physical projects

These still often involve a lot of code-type-stuff

- [Maker projects](b2694758-f919-4d46-a29b-7bbf189eab38.md)
- [NodeMCU ESP{8266,32} Projects](be8ef21f-ea6e-4f96-8b87-9a54694fb29f.md)

Similarly, there are local endeavors that take on the characteristics of a "project":

- [Desktop Quests](445ae6d8-5796-43b7-8648-704c8ebb9e18.md)
- [Junkyard Daydreams](33bcb20b-5d20-42e5-8eba-15541882e48a.md)

## Other creative project like stuff

- [game projects](47a84b6f-b858-4064-9563-00230ab4c1e5.md)
- [Big Titles](e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md), a kind of incubator for [messay](8f2359ae-186f-4878-b5e5-33f3c177e6fc.md) clusters
- [Pitches and Scripts](b297a6f8-5646-4ce1-9be1-d7ed6056a513.md)

## Other speculative dens of creation or whatever

- [Community Wishlist](cbf8b20c-fd72-4c42-a543-952e046c893b.md), for organizations I wish existed
- [Method Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), for "projects" that are just "coming up with ways to do things"

## And finally

- [Odd Project Ideas](cbe928d9-338d-402c-a1c3-5c1ab5704bb5.md), the tavern-page for projects that don't fit prominently into the above

## Very Special Projects

- [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) (the tools and spec that govern these notes) gets a special link here because it's a node I need to jump a lot from

## Other project-related pages

the [Notestack Core](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) is the node in these notes where projects tend to form.

There's [this stub for a Tech Tree](0031208d-0493-4dcf-9d70-6dbf1daaa52c.md) (previously known as Toolchained Melody) that might be another page to explore some kind of structure wherein projects here can enable other projects.

For other context that *might* explain some of these, see [Right Now][] and [News][].
