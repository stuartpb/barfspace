# Reviving the Sandbox

This is something I got sidetracked on about a year ago: I should get back to that.

https://github.com/plushu/sandbox.plushu.org/issues/2

- [ ] Make sure sandbox.plushu.org et al point to Packet.
- [ ] Set up a new watchdog for the sandbox.
  - [ ] Set up a timer.
  - [ ] Set up a service that runs outside the VM for the sandbox itself.
- [ ] Delete the Digital Ocean droplet for the old sandbox.

I've been looking at KataKoda, and now I'm thinking that's probably the right approach to show off Plushu-family projects: I wonder how much of their implementation is bespoke...

But, like, they must have figured out a sensible way to do public free vm-cluster-exposing stuff, so, like, I don't need to reinvent the wheel on it

An honest idea: the most sensible way to test Plusku et al at this point might be to get the Clusterhood going on the down-low
