# More on the "comically simple desktop system" idea

What about Git as a folder? Like, the Working Tree only exists as a thing you can drag to and from the index / objects

Like, hey cool yeah here's an idea: a desktop metaphor for the Git model

It's not even that far off from the actual data model, just that this renders suff like "parent" as a clickthrough link

Heh, what if the location bar had all the different kinds of Git navigation as buttons (like "Day before", things like that), and instead of the hash or bath, it's the command line refspec to produce this view

## While we're talking about tree views for things that don't normally get that treatment

- [Editor History as a WIP Branch](1dzb3-gbj93-ma8t8-p06mh-3j1mh)
  - So like, this remote driver would allow for this model of inspection? wild
