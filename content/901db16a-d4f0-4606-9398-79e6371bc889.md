# Our Wedding Rings

The Lion is the Alpha, the Unicorn is the Omega

I'm a Manic Pixie Dream Boy

Unicorn has a Golden Kallisti Apple on the horn: maybe these rings can be multi-material?

It'll just be Tiare's at first, with the Unicorn, and then I'll work on mine with the Lion for the wedding rings

Ah, heck, I'll just iterate on both

And my Lion's going to be a Suffering Bastard, like the Cowardly Lion, making the "Alpha" so discordant, I love it

The Unicorn ring has a heart on the flank

The Lion ring has a heart on the left wrist (same as Daniel Tiger's watch)

Can the entire Lion ring be a pentagon, like, it looks like a Nut? Or maybe it intersects a silver pentagon. This kinda feels like a recipe for discomfort unless the corners are rounded?

Or, better, the lion's mane forms a pentagon. Much more fitting. (though I was thinking maybe the lion doesn't have a mane)

The inside of my ring, in Dotsies, is "IN HIS HOUSE ON GOLDEN POND THE LION GENTLE SLEEPS"

the inside of Tiare's, in binary, is (ASCII span) + F0 9F A6 84 07 07 07 (1432@, Unicorn, three beeps)

maybe also something like one has CUL and the other has PER, working in a Culper Ring reference?
