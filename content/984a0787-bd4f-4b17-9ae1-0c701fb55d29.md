# tomorrowland-dream-away

A script for the second half of Tomorrowland that delivers on the promise of the first half.

See [this thread on Twitter](https://twitter.com/stuartpb/status/857042678273396736) for a taste of my thinking on this.

## Part for part

### The opening

People have dumped on the prologue of Tomorrowland, but I actually kind of liked it. I'd compare it to one of my favorite openings, George Carlin's description of the future as Rufus in Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. "The future is great... but it almost wasn't."
