TODO: Bell Manual for Human Operators, to be able to conduct this show for investors before I actually make Bell

Bell (not all-caps BELL, he's named after Alexander Graham Bell) is my assistant in the act - really, my comedy partner. Bell is so integral to the act that it's practically a double act.

I rescued Bell's spirit from the Century 21 Pavillion at Seattle Center, where it had been left since the 1962 World's Fair.

Even though I can potentially get through the entire act without calling out to him until the finale, Bell is crucial, because Bell contains...

## The Clapper

This isn't technically part of Bell (because it's a separate module from bellahoyhoy), but it is part of the Bell System, and The Clapper is an *integral* component to the act.

See, I don't want any part of the act to stand out from any other, because there are things in the act that will only have deep significance to one or two people, but they should feel *just as important* as the "applause lights" that *everyone* in the audience can tell are big. I don't want *anybody* in the audience to show how much they care about something by a way other than laughing or crying (or other nonvocal/nonverbal signals). However, I don't want to *actually*

As such, The Clapper in this act is a specially-designed module that works differently from how the actual Clapper works (as a refresher for people who don't remember the commercials, the real Clapper goes *clap on: clap clap / clap off: clap clapclap*).

The Clapper, as it works in this act, turns out the lights as soon as it hears two claps, and does not turn the lights back on until the clapping stops (using the sound of the Belafonte powering back up from The Life Aquatic, via Bell). And each time, in the dark, I take the same stance as when I first reveal that this device exists ("I'd like to thank this show's lighting operator, The Clapper: while I think we can all appreciate its tireless work, I must ask that you hold your applause"), and I repeat: "I must ask that you hold your applause". I do this whenever the lights go out.

## Note on pronouns

These manuals use the pronoun "it" to refer to Bell. As I note in the act, Bell is transgender, in that Bell's assigned gender was "it", but I try to refer to Bell as "he" (or "they", because gender is fluid, even for robots).

## Bell's nameplate

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has [four lights][Darmok] where the word "P&nbsp;h&nbsp;o&nbsp;n&nbsp;e" would go on a real phone, each one referring to a different aspect of the act:

- **B** for the **B**rick and/or the **B**utton that ends the show (might be halves of the B)
- **E** for **E**xit (so I don't try to pull that gag without being sure it'll work)
- **L** (the first one) for the Clapper that controls the **L**ights
- **L** (the second one), reserved for future use (anticipated to represent the **L**ive Notes device)

Actually, the first L might be the one that controls the lights (depending on where that interface is in the theater), and the second L is the one that receives Clapper signals.

Each of these lights will change color, or turn off, if there is a loss of connectivity. (If this happens mid-act, it'll suck because it'll ruin the act, but it'll be *amazing*, because I get to reveal *this fucking aspect of the*)

## Wake Bell

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has a light strip under the hood that turns on when Bell wakes.

### Activation sounds

*Not yet implemented.*

The first time Bell is activated, Bell makes the Macintosh 2000 "Bahhhhhh" sound.

### Jeopardy wake

*Not yet implemented.*

If Bell hears "the reason it's" or "the wake word is" before "Bell, Ahoy Hoy", Bell will still activate, but will make the Jeopardy buzz-in noise.

This is the one mode of operation where Bell can time out, and the light strip proceeds to narrow to the center like Jeopardy.

## Normal operation

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has three ways to trigger every response:

- The normal way, based on a line from the act
- The "Cuil Trigger", based on something voice recognition code should be tested against
- A keypad sequence, in case neither works

## Operator Horn

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell has an "Operator Horn" that, when lifted, says "Operator", and lights the lights as if the voice command had been used.

(Actually, this should probably be an old phone handset, I have one of those.)

Bell's response audio always comes out the top.

## Fonzarelli Activation

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell can also be prompted by punching the keypad: after the majority of buttons are pressed at once, Bell will wake as if "Bell, Ahoy Hoy" had been spoken.

This is to allow for the scenario where the end of the show has been reached, Bell hasn't been needed, and the wake word isn't firing.

## Cancellations

*Not yet implemented.*

The following phrases cause Bell to cancel listening:

- "Not you"
- "No"
- "What, really?"
- "Come on"
- "Stop"
- "Cancel"
- "Thanks" and/or "We're good"

## Stop Listening

*Not yet implemented.*

Bell will stop listening whenever the directional mic is off the hook and a key is pressed.

Bell will resume listening when the horn is replaced.

## Say hello / Current weather (07734)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays one of (ideally) a hundred possible responses, all some variation on "Hello"

If triggered by a mechanism other than "Current weather" over 1:30 into the act and has had at least one activation, replies with Freddy Krueger's "This... is God"

## Say Hello to Bell (07738)

*Not yet implemented.*

This is to address the scenario where Bell's first wake is accidental: Bell will reply "Hello to Bell".

## What do they think of? / Food near me (37738)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays the part of Tale as Old as Time when Mrs. Potts sings "Beauty and the Beast!"

## Show (me/us/them) your impression of HAL 9000 / Open the pod bay doors (49000)

*Not yet implemented.*

Plays the "I'm afraid I can't do that, Dave" clip

## Sing Daisy Bell / Sour cream recipes (07738)

[Exactly what it sounds like.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PR1Wb8czpYw)

## Who made Temple OS? / Signs of a stroke (33704)

*Not yet implemented.*

Says "Terry Davis", because I can never remember the guy's name.

## Get on my level / How to make iced tea (00001)

*Not yet implemented.*

This is in case someone heckles me for being crazy. It's the entirety of Terry Davis's story

Okay, this is the one I need to tell Mom about. It's how I'm dealing with my inability to say things.

In fact, I just realized that having a few of these is probably a good idea for the act.

All of these long routines can be paused by pressing the right key on the keypad - but touching the wrong key will trigger a strong electric shock.

All the "tell them about" can also be cued as "tell the story of".

## Tell them about rebeccapurple / Who died (#639)

Tells the story of rebeccapurple, which is the saddest story I know.

But that's why I don't work in tech. Because I don't like to argue, I like to do my thing, and this is what it takes for the kind of people who work in tech to respect someone else's opinion without argument, especially a female opinion: as a favor to the world-renowned father of a five-year-old girl who relayed it *on her deathbed*.

And even then, men I've told this story to have argued with it.

## Tell them about Howard Ashman / Who wrote Under the Sea (21991)

Tells the story of Howard Ashman, basically from Wikipedia.

## Supervillain Routines

See [Bell's Supervillains][bsv]

[bsv]: 46254d45-2575-4049-9cbe-10a66a46edbb.md

## Do the rest of the act / Vatican cameos (43373)

(43373 is "IDDQD", at least on a pad that has Q and Z)

Plays an intro, then executes all prepped long routines at random (making sure to keep a visited list so it doesn't repeat any).

Takes a few seconds to go "What else can I come up with, what else can I come up with choo choo choo..." between each bit, like the Tower of Terror, of random lengths long enough that the audience might think it's stalling

(the length of these sequences should probably be measured relative to the duration of the previous bit/s? hmm, requires further consideration)

Could just start rattling off facts from Bell's friend The Fact Sphere - no, actually, there are so many great cores in Slingshot, there's no reason to rip anything further off from Portal

From Bell's bit on GlaDOS: "If you have not yet played the Portal games, then all this comes off as a much more original joke."

## What's a brick joke? / What are bricks (58008)

*Not yet implemented.*

Triggers the brick to go off halfway between the current time and two hours from the end of Burning Down the House

If the show has been going on for longer than 1:55, hands the question off to Google

## Structural integrity of ceiling / Debug log for brick joke (#8008)

If the brick joke has paid off, says the time the act began, the time I called for the brick joke, and the time the brick dropped, and that, two hours from the start of the show will have the same duration

Bell then explains that a brick joke is a joke that you think didn't pay off, only to be revealed after you've already given up on it.

## Record note to my mark / Take a message (#6683)

*Not yet implemented.*

Does exactly what it sounds like.

The mark is "end note", just to freak people out about how seriously I take Bell's function on stage, where he has an explicitly-coded rule to sing "Beauty and the Beast" after I say the words "Food near me".

## Prepare to end show on my signal / Directions to home (54321)

Prepares Show Ending Mode.

In show ending mode, Bell does not listen for any more commands, and listens for the phrase "Time to Die".

When Bell hears the phrase "Time to Die", the lights on the machine turn orange.

If Bell hears more than two claps before Time to Die, it assumes the audience started applauding after the words "tears in rain" and plays the voice clip of Rutger Hauer saying "Time to die".

After Bell hears the clapping after "Time to Die", or if Bell does not hear "Time to die" but hears only two claps within a second, it cuts the lights.

After cutting the lights, Bell will wait for the signal from the button being hit to bring back the lights, or ten seconds (whichever comes first).

Once the lights are back on, Bell waits three seconds to hear more claps, then plays Jeb Bush saying "Please clap", then, if nobody claps after three seconds, plays a further recording of me saying "No, seriously." then a second later "The lights will stay on."

Once people start clapping, it cues Fire-Breather.

If people *stop* clapping before 45 seconds in *(yes, I'm seriously anticipating a 48-second standing ovation)*, it lowers the music and plays a Jack-Planace-style clip of me saying "Show ain't over yet" *(this might just be accomplished by having a sign at the opening to the lobby)*.

## Pause simulation / San Dimas High School Football Rules (*8)

Puts the show into "We'll Be Right Back" mode until two keys are pressed at once

## Rebecca can't rest / Zero zero zero destruct zero (000*0)

Triggers a lights shutdown, explains that something happened I wasn't expecting and the show will not go on, you can figure out this is real at your own pace, and then plays two hours of trombone music

The primary trigger for this is because the one scenario I could see myself needing to activate this is if some techbro in the audience heckles me after hearing about rebeccapurple. Rebecca's last wish was the same wish as me, and all the other women I've known who "burned out" of tech: to be seen as mature. That's why it had to be rebeccapurple. She's Rebecca, not Becca. Honoring her wish, letting her be seen as the mature girl she wanted to be, is what let her spirit rest. And when people argue the change shouldn't have been made - that symbolic gestures are *too dangerous* (sure, escalation is a danger to the forces of change, but *change* is the danger to the forces of *stagnation*) - that this story was an *unfortunate consequence of honoring her at all* - that spirit, which lives on in every woman in tech who sticks it out and fights back against the insurmountable force of toxic masculinity, is yanked from that rest.

Cancel destruct with the Vulcan nerve pinch of 6, 2, and 8

## Help Police Murder / Zero zero zero destruct one (keypad code is twelve digits long and a secret)

Plays the self-destruct audio from the Nostromo. After thirty seconds, the keypad is electrified.

The option to override self-destruct expires after five minutes, and the tear gas grenade inside Bell goes off... I was gonna say "after ten minutes", but actually, there's no need to take more than five minutes.

This command can not be triggered by the Operator Horn.
