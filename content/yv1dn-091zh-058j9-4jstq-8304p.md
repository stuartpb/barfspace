# Mastodon / Federated Tumblr (Diaspora?) Hashflags / Tag Style System

This intersects with some of my other ideas, like Erisel and the whole Eleventy Redux thing

what if there were like, something Charts you could install, taking a certain class of values like a CRD, or a TypeScript definition, or some other kind of schema-enforced checker. You'd look at the template to assess that it was OK (like, only injecting a narrow-in-scope injection, like a string that will represent a rendered value for the CSS background-color property)

and then you'd install a document like "insert hashflags"

hmm, so that'd mean you'd also have to have transforming middleware, wouldn't it? or could you have a limited-class transformation like "transform elements with this selector to add this class or attribute"

this is starting to turn into an idea for a browser extension format like ViolentMonkey, too

## real side thought

you could have "security approvers" for extensions be like distro groups (because, verifying that code is safe, secure, and reliable is a majority of a packager's work), and their sources are like repos where you can switch authority pretty easily

incidentally this is kind of what's emerging with container repos
