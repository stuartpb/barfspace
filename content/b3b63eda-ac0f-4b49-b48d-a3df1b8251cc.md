# The Perils of Too-Heavy Protection

**A healthy model of security must recognize that it faces *two* failure scenarios: *breach* and *lockout*.**

Accessibility is just as important of a concern as protection, if not more so.

If your security model does not provide authorized personnel reliable access to the thing it secures, it faces an attack on the basis of lockout. It *also* raises the potential of routine circumvention, lowering its ability to prevent a breach.

Even if users *don't* start circumventing onerous restrictions, they can still have a detrimental effect: if they'd be burdened with security restrictions in order to, say, serve a customer more fully, those who would be authorized to do so may decline to take action, due to the effort-consuming process that would be involved.

Properly-followed restrictions can even pose security hazards, in situations where the protected asset is needed as part of a critical response.

Full-disk encryption does a great job of restricing the readability of your data, but forget the importance of your *own access* to the key, and you've paved a golden runway way for attackers to hold your disk at ransom.
