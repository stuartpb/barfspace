# shitty endeavors with bad memories

throwing a bunch of links here because I'm not cutting them yet, but I no longer care to see them mixed in with possibly better stuff

## Tech projects

- [A thing I am working on for canvassing](q2xxh-pffg8-ca8ze-m2xx3-5gs0q)

## Anarchy in the DSA

[A proposal to "soft-split" the LSC from DSA ahead of the convention](sejm5-txehc-4m957-mtczq-twwh2) (basically empty because i care so little about this right now, whatever)

## DSA.FYI: The Cutting Room Floor

Pardon our [dust][and echoes].

This content may eventually get put back somewhere within https://DSA.FYI/ proper: until then, they live in my notes.

This'll be where I stash stuff I decide the report needs to cut to be more cohesive. (Previously, it was pretty much "just throw everything in, the longer it is the less likely the people that it describes are to read it, and the funnier this gets")

- this list is where I'd put items if I didn't feel like just dropping DSA.FYI altogether for now

Other weird castoff notes on the project:

- [The Rules][]

[The Rules]: mcqq1-g4bp4-8597z-ajgx4-t60mk

## Other wasted labor on the Seattle DSA

[Notes for reforming the bylaws][bylaws] that I was given zero seconds to read at the Seattle DSA 2019 convention (no, I am not exaggerating)

[bylaws]: rpfe7-bnvba-r99w4-3n3sg-4sm0q

## Circus Rosa

- [My proposal for a commercial to FPCOT][crc]
