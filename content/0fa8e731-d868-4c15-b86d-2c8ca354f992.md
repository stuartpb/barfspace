# Gibernetes

The core idea: a combination of `kubectl` and `helm` designed for manipulating a Git repostory of charts and manifests (ie. to be deployed via Flux/Argo)

so you'd have `gibe{,ctl} install` to add a Helm chart to `charts`, with a `values` entry for any `--set`

and also `gibe{,ctl} create` and/or `apply` to add a manifest to `templates`

could have [Cluster Explorer](989ccbc6-fd86-454c-ae87-21b20a54e479.md) as some kind of API, though you'd kind of need [Better Helm](092f6a7b-eb45-4135-bc72-435b387e7223.md)
