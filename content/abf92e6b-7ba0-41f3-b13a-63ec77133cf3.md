# Federating and Distributing Trees like These Notes

This is kind of related to the [BISNES/BIGDOG][] stuff, as well as the Federated World stuff (should maybe be kept on a "proto-BIGDOG" notes page here linked from [The Shadow Curtain][])

[BISNES/BIGDOG]: bfdafa43-6389-46c1-a308-8e6cc68bf0a3.md
[The Shadow Curtain]: e50eb50f-cc83-43b5-888a-d2ae77daf8a5.md

Note that these tooling considerations also affect a single user managing content across [The Shadow Curtain](e50eb50f-cc83-43b5-888a-d2ae77daf8a5.md)

## A thought from revamping Messays

I was remarking on how I could want to do something like TVTropes' Laconic wiki, and then I realized that that can be a concept "forking" an existing bagtent wiki's symbols: to make alternate versions of the same content with a different "tone" or whatever

## Modeling Collaboration and Contribution

PAges considering what'd be needed to start federating:
