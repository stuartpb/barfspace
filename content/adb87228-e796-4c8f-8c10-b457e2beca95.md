# The Project Akira mess

This is a reflection on how Project Akira repeatedly covered a sort of "allusion" to "things that need to get done in integrating work into these notes", in a way that there ended up being several redundant descriptions of the work to be done.

I think this page is such a mess because I forgot where I got this idea to merge in Lean Notes to barfspace originally? It was when I realized that I wanted the revamped bagtent-based barfspace to have Linkdumps, then I realized that that's a lot of what the function of Lean Notes was, and that started the gears turning

Anyway, the way that this didn't have that clear "origin" at the top is I think a big part of why I kept, like churning on "here's a related project", because I vaguely recalled formulating it, but couldn't remember where.

It was in Barfspace Vision Quests (now home to the [Academy of Belfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md)), and I guess I was only looking in Operations, because I forgot what a mess BVQ was?

ADHD sucks like this, y'all!!
