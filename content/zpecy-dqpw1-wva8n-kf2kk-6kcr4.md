so I'm thinking these will be specified using something like a [Markdown loosely-structred document data model](g6k8m-cw8ed-47awn-3jp7d-k8vck)

Also, there should be a style guide. If a sense is an abbreviation, it will contain "Abbrev."

This is what we do instead of tags, we list out "CommonJS function." or "ECMAScript keyword."

"See also" can link to plural forms - plural forms are expected to link to their singular

- [Possible jumping-off point](https://github.com/Kong/apiglossary)
  - (in hindsight, "glossary" is probably a clearer term for this)
  - [license](https://github.com/Kong/apiglossary/issues/17) would need to be sorted out first
