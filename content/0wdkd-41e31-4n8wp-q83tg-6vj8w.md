# Windows problems on Stutendo

## No Failover to Vive

This is a problem I forgot I was having: I can't turn off my monitor at night because it displays my desktop on the Vive.

One workaround for this would be to have the monitor turn off from Windows in software. Most of [these](https://www.maketecheasier.com/turn-off-windows-screen/) are hacky, but [this one](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Turn-off-screen-4d173e0a) is the one that's *programmatically* hacky, so I might go for it. (Again: *holy mother of god Windows is such a ghetto.*)
