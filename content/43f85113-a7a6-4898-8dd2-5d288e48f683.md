# Probably a good network idea for Stubernetes nodes

I should make the Stubernetes switch its own isolated network, where I can reach nodes on port 22 for SSH via the Wifi, but inter-cluster communication only binds on the Ethernet. That way it wouldn't be a thing where I need to trust my Wi-Fi to keep internal traffic secure.

Would this be feasible to do using a Raspberry Pi acting as a router?
