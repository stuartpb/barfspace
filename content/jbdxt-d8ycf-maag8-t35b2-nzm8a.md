# the twist between UEJI and Osterhex

Split of from notes about the name on [The Easter Witch](dbz98-cnshf-e1aqp-p82zn-z574f):

- Is she someone's gratuitous (self-insert) fan-fiction avatar?
    - Is that why she's in there as an Easter egg?
      - I'ts like the "wacky" random encounters in Fallout
      - And the devs thought it would be karmically funny to indulge this gratuitous self-creation?
        - And they don't realize what a thorough favor they've done (easter "egg", lol)
    - It's like Callister, where she's turned into the girl from the poster she makes fun of as a cruel joke?

## that's the thing that ties these acts together

Jason Innput and Batty Buddhabone are the same person. The same original consciousness.

The spell that kills Jason was supposed to include a part where he forms a "whoami" request, and that was supposed to be the thing he said (it was in the pages he drunkenly wrote the night before, after coming to remember/realize/recognize/understand the world around him); but he forgot to swap that page in (you can hear thunder strike twice at the splice points)

when Batty finds it and fixes it later, the response it echoes back (in Luvuk) is "jbudabon" - maybe it can be in a format like MessagePack or ed or something where there'd be bytes on either end you might miss and think are part of the protocol. and it can be ambiguous (from the documentation! not thhat any of this detail would be explicitly mentioned) whether or not the other fields in the spell structure (like, this aspect is implementation-dependent as, while the way other fields like it suggest it would be the identity of the caster) would or would not influence

anyway, this ambiguity introduces the "she's actually Jason Budabon's imaginary waifu" fan explanation

## the blatant trans symbolism

it's like, if ya'll didn't get it with the matrix maybe you'll get it this time

he dies because of a toxic masculine drive to prove himself, even when he knows he should be playing it more safe. he's worried (and, like, this isn't expressed, this is just an internal thing) that backing down would damage his already-tenuous grasp on control of the thing he understands, so he plays that game he's rigged to lose

this is kind of based on a thing I've heard expressed a few times in trans circles: if a "darkest timeline" cis version of themselves still existed, they would have fallen into a destructive cycle years prior

hence "Easter witch" can be seen as a kind of play on words, with the "witch" being a form of rebirth
