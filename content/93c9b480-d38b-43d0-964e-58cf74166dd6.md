(me, thinking about chess for six seconds)... holy shit the edges of the board represent the coasts of a continent... (thinks about the one thing I know about chess) holy shit the continent is India

Oh hey, where did this game of arcane rules, heavy power imbalances, and a social esteem for rote memorization as much as ability come from? oh, and also I'm interested in the history of Chess
