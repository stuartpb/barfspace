# Grand Unified Ticket System

This is an idea I've had: an issue tracker dedicated to tracking issues with anything, whether it's a project that you control or not (think https://github.com/isaacs/github, but for anything). Like, you can just post an error message you've got, and people will find your issue via Google and post comments and links to solutions.

Like, I guess the big idea of this is to flip the traditional model of issue tracking on its head, that the power to collectivize issues should lie primarily with the *users*, with the developers *hopefully* engaging. Like, this isn't meant to supplant a project's issue management paradigm, when one's established and well-managed: it's to make it so a project doesn't *have* to have one of those things for users with problems to be able to find each other, diagnose the issue, and figure out fixes / workarounds.

One of the big features of this would be to interface with external trackers for tracking issue status; another cool feature could be basically setting up Google alerts for key apects of the issue (eg. the error message) automatically.

Also, looking at another project I had specced up many years ago, it might make sense to have a system for easily provisioning *private* tickets, to track things like RMAs and personal to-do lists.

## Isn't this just solvable with bagtent?

Like, let Google be your query method, and let pull requests or email or whatever be your discussion and update mechanism

## Adjunct: Knowledge Base for Everything

What if people could exchange troubleshooting for certain classes of issue by, like, posting a to-do list that people could follow to diagnose the issue? This split off from an item in the [Barfspace Vision Quests][BVQ], described as "Writing Questions In The Form of RPG-Style Quests"

I guess the key idea is that this could be extended out to general problem-solving, and not just "this thing is broken"? But yeah, there's also the notion of "posting an article posing a question, and letting someone fork it to add the answer"

So, hmm, maybe this is the idea to offshoot... what if there was a site like GitHub, but for soliciting general pull requests? That's an interesting idea, I'll add a thing for it to the main Project list since it's hardly strictly a bagtent thing
