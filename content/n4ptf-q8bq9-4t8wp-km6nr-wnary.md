## haskell thoughts

There's been a thihg where I've been thinking I'd like to specify alphabi in Haskell

https://github.com/tweag/asterius would maybe facilitate that

## notes on the name

these were uncommitted in my old experimentation repo, they're not really "data" so I'm probably just going to record them here then bubble them

```
alphabet binary
alphabinary
alphabi (alphabin, alphabits)
a0z1
az01
01az
a01z
0a1z
0az1
maybe vary these based on non-az/latin/space/punct rules
"experiment a0z1"
```
