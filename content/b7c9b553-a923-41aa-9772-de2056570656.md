# Bagtent Browser Note Hub

This page aggregates everything around a good UI for browsing / editing [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md).

The notes on that page are important, and might even make sense for some of those to be integrated into the view from this vantage.

Actually, going through now... I think what's really needed right now is an index collecting this whole aspect of Bagtent.

## Meta thought

This should be dragged to the Oozy Sewer, but these subpages are being merged in when they were only ever one heading/section long, and cherry-picked from when they're longer

## Navigation notes

This is the stuff that used to be on [this page](bf03649f-7721-4d95-af2e-bfe803bf996a.md) (or should have been?)
