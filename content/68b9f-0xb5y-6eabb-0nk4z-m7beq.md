# Featurelets

sprung off of "things you could have on the [VS Code Feature Wishlist and other noted issues](5dmqe-0kc7e-ab83f-6sxcx-c0wv1)"

but also kind of applicable to browsers? and solved there? see how this transitions into my argument for a Windowsystem Metabrowser model.

## forked off thought here

have everything run under a privileged Window Frame in a Kiosk. Or, like, Servo or something: can you hook Servo right up to Wayland?

Anyway I'm thinking I'd start from a basis of Kubic, and then go to town

## anyway, the scope

- things that could maybe be implemented using existing features
    - macros, scriptlets, one-liners, aliases, things like that
      - maybe things that *could* be these in another programming environment (like vim or emacs), but in VS Code would have to be an extension ro something
        - and you'd maybe make them like Greasemonkey userscripts, which is fine
          - Oh damn, a thing about using VS Code through the browser - you can drop ViolentMonkey on it
