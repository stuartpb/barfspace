# Knowing Where We Have Been

I think I remember what I was going to put here now: a note on how the main utility of writing things down is to just not repeat ourselves. If we don't log what we've done, we're liable to go around in circles, not remembering why we ran into trouble in the first place.

I mean, you know, "those who don't know history are doomed to repeat it", but this can even apply at the individual level, or at the interpersonal level: you become more effective if you can study your contemporaries' history and current work?

I should probably merge the stuff below into this thesis - I should also have a musing on the Fermat's Lat Theorem problem, where I start writing something, get distracted, then I come back and all I see was the record that I was about to start describing something ("on the constantly terrifying fear I have of leaving a pivotal sentence incomplete", as I originally termed it when I was characterizing this page at [The Rest][])

## previous content below

I created a file with this name on 2018-04-15 back when barfspace was a flat tree of named files, but it was empty until 2018-09-18, when I filled in a comment about not knowing where the file's content had been. Since I had the workspace it was in set to auto-save, it would seem that I never got around to writing anything in that file.

This is one of the reasons I'm designing the new shotclock system for barfspace to have a mechanism that prevents me from spawning files created with no context (designing systems for creating files off of a new or unlinked reference, and/or refusing to commit when there are files without inbound links).

My original thinking was that this was probably going to be something like what I eventually wrote in one of the other files in this repo, but I'm not sure which, so I'm going to start using this as a sort of "topic index" for the general globular cluster around "things that get me thinking about history and presence of mind":

- [News is History][]
- [Squashing the Deltas][]
- The [Clusterhood][] spitballing document kind of touches on the theme of "you have to show your work"
- Have I written anything about petlogs? This is a big part of how petlogs are useful

ADDENDUM 2019-05-20 (when I remembered what I was going to write): I don't think we're ready for a true nexus on this, I think this one's going to have to be more web/cloud-y of interlinks with no center for now

The idea of recording "Mood Constellations" somewhere is an interesting one, though, and one that's probably worth exploring in the Construction Office zone at some point (that's kind of what the function of plopping this into The Rest was meant to track)
