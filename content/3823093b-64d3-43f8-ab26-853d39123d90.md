# Datasheet-type collections and self-made references

- [Age Thresholds to Know](339f091d-874a-4380-952f-0b206e32eee0.md)
- [Esoteric Units of Measurement](648306bb-7701-4f42-9913-d28984df7ee1.md)

## Bigger projects

These are more ambitious, aiming to be community projects like wikis.

- [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words](fd9ccf36-f6e0-47bb-a456-6f14e669b304.md)
- the [Open Profilogical Web Survey](144ec8bd-d6cb-47b7-aa60-7220f6d5b4f2.md)

There are more of these kinds of thing scattered throughout [Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md): suitably large collections will be split out to their own pages and linked both from the page from their original Lean Notes context and here.
