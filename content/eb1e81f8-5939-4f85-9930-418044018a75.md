# Department of Barfspace

The Department of Barfspace is the district of notes concerned with introspecting the structure of the notes, and acting on that introspection by reshaping to fit. (This is a constant dance we do.)

Put another way: this is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way, as well as a collection of notes reflecting on patterns that have cropped up (especially through History Force)

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo][OBR].

## The Quests

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests][] was eventually divided up into three "domains":

- [Barfspace Operations][], dealing with legacies, maintenance and the like
- [Barfspace Visions][], dealing with new explanatory content and structure, aspirations like that
- Barfspace Implementations, which became the Notestack Engineering Core (see below)

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md
[Barfspace Operations]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[Barfspace Visions]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md

Most of the "quests" that were drafted before this split were very inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

In fact, this kind of not-having-a-page-for-individual-quests thing kind of dates back to back when conjuring pages was more awkward. Now, we're moving each of these quests to their own page, and as the pages get lighter (with the cruftier and more-confused pieces getting shunted out of sight), modern roles for these pages are emerging.

## Implementation Operations Adjunct

For notes around the implementation of the notes, see the [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) note nexus, managed by The [Notestack Core of Engineers](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md) an affiliate agency to the Department of Barfspace that paves the way for and informs a lot of content work, but isn't a true content agency like these (meaning it's not working in Barfspace).
