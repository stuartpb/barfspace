# NEWS for the End of September 2018

I was up until 2 AM on Monday night assembling my new [Prusa i3 MK3][], and it's thrown my whole sleep schedule out of whack, so I really need to just cut this commit and go to bed

Speaking of ways this printer is interfering with my sleep, I'm thinking about modifying the circuit on my LED board like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymwqs_njZbk) (or just decoupling the LCD from the board and getting a new board with this change I'd want?) so that the LED conneection is instead a header, and that header is jumpered by default, but you can plug in cables to introduce a switch / resistance to the circuit.

I'm going to be going to two separate cousin weddings in the next two weeks. Note to self: don't forget to make a "wed me up when september ends" joke
