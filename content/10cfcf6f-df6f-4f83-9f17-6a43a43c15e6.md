## Related

- the [Ops in a Box](035d1e22-7dca-4901-aa4a-1624e7a6a15c.md) project describes the vision that originally drove Plushu, which is now its own thing at a few levels that would most likely not use Plushu much, if at all
- [Gitolite](670af243-aa7d-49c0-af30-e0cc1e8f491d.md) is still around - would be cool to redesign Plushu in a way that would work well with that?

## to pull from

[kubernetes note on images](0630c9a3-aa16-415b-a9b6-a4e507211b1e.md) has a section that applies here, might make sense merged into one of the divergences in the brainstorming group
