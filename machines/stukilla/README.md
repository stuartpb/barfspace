This is a cheap first-generation Samsung Chromebook that I've reflashed to run Arch Linux ARM.

Honestly, it's always been a mess, and the entire system appears to have become hopelessly stuck, so I'm thinking I'll probably blow away the current installation soon in favor of either another Arch Linux installation from scratch, or possibly a foray into Gentoo.
