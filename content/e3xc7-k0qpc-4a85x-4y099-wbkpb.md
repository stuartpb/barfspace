# stutendo

This is my Windows 10 installation on my home desktop, which has various augmentations to afford most of the comforts of a proper Free Software programming environment, in various contexts (including an Ubuntu install through the Linux Subsystem for Windows, a standalone MSYS2 installation, and the fork of MSYS used by Git for Windows).

## other visits to stutendo since fixing the password

Somewhere around early 2019 (might have been around September) I locked myself out of the Windows install an chilled out all in [Stushiba](c2txf-hdscr-t99xp-4jrjj-beh02).
