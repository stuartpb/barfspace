# On Refactoring from a Jam Page

- I wrote several different kinds of page all at once to Thread Jam.
  - using headings and lists makes that easier to break out appropriately later
  - And, of course, sometimes I just need to refactor a tree / sentence into another kind/level of tree
  - When you're editing different parts of a tree
    - (whether they're different siblings in a list or different sections in a document)
    - you tend to jump around
      - you know, thoughts forking, more context needed for two different chains, things like that

## Speaking of IDE support

VS Code lets you collapse lists by hovering / clicking in the margin between text and line numbers, just like functions etc.
