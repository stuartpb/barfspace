# Semantic Markdown

[This blog post from 2013](https://nikcodes.com/2013/08/20/semantic-markdown/) lays out the conceptual space neatly:

- Semantic Release Notes
- API Blueprint
- Fountain

## Related nodes in these notes

  - Kind of like a spec for generic-Markdown-to-object semantics
- the new spec for the [Open Dictionary of Reserved Words](fd9ccf36-f6e0-47bb-a456-6f14e669b304.md)
- [bagtent index](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md) has a lot more Markdown-adjacent content
  - especially the "Codebook"

## Additional Markdown rules

"Semantic Markdown", as I see it, is about using *existing Markdown constructs for further semantic structure* (like API Blueprint) more than extending the syntactic constructs of Markdown itself - but, of course, as Markdown's syntax degrades gracefully, this line can be blurry

These are some notes (which could maybe be split to a separate page) on the custom Markdown rules the first half of the article talks about a bit, somewhat overlapping with my "Flavored Markdown" concept.

I like Markdown Extra's definition list syntax, and MultiMarkdown's citations.
