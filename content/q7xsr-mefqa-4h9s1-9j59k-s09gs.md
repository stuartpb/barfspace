# when asked if I will port Tabalanche to Mac/Safari

Only if you buy me one, too - Apple doesn't let people without Macs develop for Mac. https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions

That said, if I did have a Mac, it looks like porting the extension would be pretty straightforward: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/safariservices/safari_web_extensions/converting_a_web_extension_for_safari

If you want to try your hand at it yourself, I just went ahead and pushed the change I wrote a year and a half ago that ported Tabalanche to the WebExtension API (for Firefox, but Safari says they have it too): https://github.com/tabalanche/tabalanche-extension (the bundle identifier would be "com.tabalanche.extension".) Feel free to run your own build of it, just don't put it on the App Store.
