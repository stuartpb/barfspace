# Procedures and Praxis

A friend of mine tried to get me into D&D once, but I told him I wasn't into it: I wasn't the type to get into all that mathy, abstract stuff.

That's not how a good game of D&D goes, though, he told me. A good game of D&D is just like a game of make-believe: everybody at the table just makes up something they'd like to do, and the DM uses those rules to *simulate* what they described.

"But at that point, why have the DM at all?", I said, my mind always striving toward anarchy. "Why not just spitball without any rules?"

"For the same reason games of make-believe always fell apart when we were kids," he told me: "if you're making it all up based on gut feelings, then everybody just wants everything to go their way when it suits them."

"Even when you're not playing *against* each other, the rules keep you grounded in reality - they force you to confront the real shortcomings with a plan like 'I jump ten feet over the fence and immediately shoot all six guards in the head'."

This stuck with me, and it's been the model for D&D's modern messaging today.

Anyway, I'm not here to talk about the rules of Dungeons & Dragons: I'm here to talk about Robert's Rules of Order.

## skipping ahead a bit

You should not need to know anything beyond the basics unless something complicated happens organically. Beware of [all the stuff on this page](fbpb5-hgrx2-c798h-z78fn-w010c) - the more you detail something, the more likely people are to start living in those details. (See also: how Star Wars was ruined by a bunch of nerds needing to know *just why* Han Solo bragged about completing the Kessel Run in parsecs, or who every single person in the Star Wars cantina was and why they were there that day)

The point of having an established definition like Robert's Rules is to act as a sort of "fair coin", where the judges *could* spend days making a case for deciding one way or the other (all the while incentivized by the particular case), but consulting the rulebook hits right to the core of what the argument would boil down to, and what is the general "good enough" solution. By putting a fine point on everything, it gives weasels far less quarter to hide in about being "treated unfairly" or whatever.

(There was some football analogy I had a while back, about something that happened in a December 2019 Seahawks game, but I can't remember what it was. Some weird NFL situation that there was, in fact, a rule on the books for, like a flag on a play that couldn't be redone.)

For example of something that can come from not having a sufficiently detailed definition, look at the issues coming from all the vague bits of our Constitution how politicized impeachment is right now, and how you have goons like Lindsay Graham, who crucified Bill Clinton over, saying we shouldn't impeach a President who is *starting a fucking war to distract from his fucking bribes*.

The purpose of the deep documented procedures is to **restore** trust in both parties operating in good faith. If the way your members use the rules make people feel confused and outflanked by an underhanded elite, *your organization has eaten itself*, and anybody who wants to get shit done should ditch it before it disappears like a black hole up its own asshole.

## more skipping ahead, put somewhere around "But aren't the rules going to force us into a corner?"

And you can always motion to suspend the rules for something both parties are willing to agree on if it doesn't fit the mold.

## What's wrong with Robert's Rules?

The main issue: even though the original archaic editions are public domain, the modern editions are not copyleft, or even easily accessible: it's only available commercially, in paper books (or on - get this - *[CD-ROM](https://www.amlegal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Robert-Rules-Order-Form_2015.pdf)*.)

There isn't really a modern open-source parliamentary procedure - there are hardly even other competing bodies of work. The next most popular is the Sturgis [Standard Code of Parliamentary Procedure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Standard_Code_of_Parliamentary_Procedure) from the American Institute of Parliamentarians, and to give you an idea of the spirit it was created in, it has a guide to using its rules in bad faith *on the inside back cover*.

In short, ther's a lot of baggage around the kind of writing

## Why not just Rusty's Rules?
