# a brief history of barfspace

(originally sent to https://twitter.com/gravislizard via Twitter DM)

Hey, I'm rereading https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html â€¦ (I don't know if I'd reread the whole thing since you updated it), and I'm at the end of the Get the Important Stuff Done section where you talk about the Scorched Earth Effect

I've been telling my therapist for a while that I should tell you about the system I've been using for my (presentable) notes, which are kind of turning into what would constitute a normal person's "blog"

but basically I designed a tech system that lets me encapsulate that entire Scorched Earth design within an organic, natural process

I haven't gotten around to writing the page that really explains how any of this came about yet but right now it's up at https://barf.space/ (the name is bad because this was originally just an experiment, I'm planning on moving it to http://notes.stuartpb.com soon)

Everything on that page is a mess and if you try to read any of the content you'll probably just get confused (sometimes the thing I write for the description of what a page is or how it works became inaccurate by the time I was done writing it), but just click around, sorta trance your way through some hyperlinks without trying to make too much sense of anything that's there: realize that these are mostly notes I've made for myself, and this has been working somewhat well for me

the key point is that each page is nameless in the data and only characterized by how it is linked to in the context of other pages

so like, if you've got something you want to write for an idea, but you can't quite figure out what you'd call it, or where you'd want to write about it, but you know what you'd want to say about how it's connected in something else you've written, you can just pop open a new file and type what's on your mind immediately, then work it into the fabric of whatever traversal mechanism you're currently trying on however feels right

and, like I said, the site's a mess and confusing to anybody who didn't write it, but, see, the beauty in it, the genius, is that's why the experiment was called "barfspace", this is why it hasn't fallen to the Scorched Earth Effect, it was *already* a mess going *into* it, there's no pristine grand plan to ruin

so I can just abandon ideas and schemes mid-way through and go back and recover anything that was worthwhile from those abandoned pages in later iterations within the tree. this is the system's normal mode of operation

it is designed to facilitate half-baked ideas in perpetuity, as effectively as possible
