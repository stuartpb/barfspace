# Self-Destructive Sequences

I'm not sure what I was going to put on this page. Was it the circumstances that trigger the Self-Destruct routines? I ended up finding that truth after thinking about Rebecca Meyer yesterday (Dec 28 2019 or so).

Ooh, was this the lead-in to the thing where I nail what's wrong with every man for himself? Because that ended up finding its way into the [Well of Souls][].

Or, oh man, if the intent of this page was to go *dark*, it could be about the freeing nature of knowing you have the power to kill, but not using it, specifically the power to destroy yourself. And I think humanity has that power, but right now, we're not using it. I don't mean the power to destroy ourselves. I mean the power to *not* destroy ourselves.
