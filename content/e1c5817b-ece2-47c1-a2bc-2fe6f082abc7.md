# My Note-Taking Beyond Bagtent

trucking this idea off from [the old Great Note Consolidation triage page][GYST]:

[GYST]: 1da0f61f-c2bb-4b9d-99da-e3f07e18556a.md

I want to explain that Google Keep is a huge supplement to this repo, somewhere. I think there's a note about me needing to explain my note-taking process somewhere around here - I'll probably work on that, at some point.

So yeah, this page will be a holding cell for thoughts around ways I currently "keep notes" that aren't reflected within this tree. (I'm trying to avoid it where possible.)

## Google Keep

This is the big one, mostly because I can't really edit this tree on my phone easily yet. (Maybe I should try Markor?)

## The Lean Notes Trello Boards

This was what originally led to the creation of bagtent, hence why merging Lean Notes into this repo is such a big deal.

## GitHub Issues

I think I've even got a thing somewhere either in this tree or in the Lean Notes Trello about "Talking to Myself", using dialogues as a way to take notes as issues.

Anyway, I'm moving away from doing this in newer projects in favor of this controllable tree I can take with me anywhere and integrate across disparate contexts and all that thinking that led to this current model.
