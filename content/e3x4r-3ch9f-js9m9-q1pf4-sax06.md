# bagtent Manual of Markdown Style

This is the manual of style I follow for Markdown syntax in my notes to help with tooling.

More thoughts on what should go here live in [this old Quest page](40axs-0yvek-sza12-egfgx-x73e1).

I'll probably make a separate style guide for my other Markdown conventions (like only using asterisks for emphasis) later.

- On writing links:
  - [Inlining links](mkj61-12ak7-rea82-ks9qe-dqwer)
    - Recommended in most cases
  - [Best Practices for Footlinks](kzsem-h7x3j-rha0x-8savw-zgy2a)
    - For the exceptions and edge cases

## historical note

pruned off from [the original bagtent ramble][mound] - most threads from there have probably been severed
