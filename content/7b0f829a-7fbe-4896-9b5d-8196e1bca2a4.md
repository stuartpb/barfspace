# Viva La Firefox

I've started using Firefox as my main browser on all my non-Chromebooks.

The main reason for this is that Google's tipped their hand with this DeclarativeWebFilter fuckery, but also:

- Edge moving to Chromium puts us dangerously close to an IE-style monoculture again
- There's that fucking bug with the massive lag spikes due to font processing on Chrome
- I should be getting out of my shell ,ore
- Firefox's perf is really good

It'd be nice if I could tell which side my active tab is scrolled off to

## Stuff I'm looking forward to

Containers is my absolute jam. I am gonna use the shit out of that for projects like Circus Rosa.

Guess that'll entail https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/ later

I've also heard good things about https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tree-style-tab/
