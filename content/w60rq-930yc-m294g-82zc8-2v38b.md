# Brooklyn Nine-Nine After 2020

so the overall flow is that Jake shoots his babysitter in the first episode, the precinct closes ranks to cover it up, Amy decides to report it, Holt threatens Jake, Jake breaks Amy's arm trying to stop her, Amy files the report anyway, she gets institutionalized, Jake fights to get her back, the NYPD commissioner disbands the entire 99th precinct as retribution, and they kidnap Jake and Amy's baby.

JAKE
When did everybody start *spitting?*

ROSA
I don't know. Right around when I started smoking.

JAKE
Rosa! You started smoking?

ROSA
We were wearing masks, nobody could smell my breath.

JAKE
But smokers are jokers!

ROSA
(pulls out a knife) *I've been under a lot of stress, OK?*
