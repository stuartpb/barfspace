# on moving CONTRIBUTING.md

The thing is, if you have case-insensitive tab completion turned on, it makes it more of a pain in the ass to type "content/"

## what I should do

just move it to `.github/CONTRIBUTING.md`, or ,really, just delete it. the whole thing was an experiment in "what if I had non-README docs outside of content/", and it's not like it really illuminated much other than "you want to keep the first few letters of content away from other existing files"
