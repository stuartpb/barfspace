# Server-As-Pet-Model-To-Be-Named Case Design

this builds off an idea I was having the other day that I think I wrote down? where a user's unit is pre-shipped with an identifier and a custom case

[Side thought about user IDs](491957d4-1a59-4970-893b-cafac94b910a.md)

So, the idea I'm thinking, we have some amount of generic casing around the internal mini-PC (be it Raspberry Pi 4)

And then we have "animal bodies" that have, like, "plugholes" all around, and stack together

I'll have to sketch out how I'm modeling this in OpenSCAD: I'm not quite sure how preciely I'd want the "body plating" to be designed

But so yeah, basically, you're making, like, dolls, toy bodies

but, in spots where you could insert arms or something, you instead put "heart light" or "belly light" or whatever flat module

or a shark fin, or a blowhole, or a robot claw, or (to be more pedestrian, but in line with the spirit of where this design originally sprung out from) a USB port (or even a rerouted 3.5" port, or HDMI, or even a MicroSD slot)

## how this is a rig

and here's the clever bit: the inside has a hook that's stretching a hair tie (or other kind of elastic band) to the other end

and this all stretches juust right to hold a plain old Raspberry Pi case snugly

Maybe, for the head end at least, there's a little "X" insert that braces on some inner shelf

and so that lets users customize whatever pogo pin / HAT battery backup / whatever enhancements on the unit itself

## goals

so, while it's got all that, it's also got space inside for the pi to be accompanied with accessories it might want, like a Coral TPU, or a hub, or a flash drive (plugging something straight into the side may entail aligning it with a protuberance)

Thinking about it right now, I think the initial SKU should ship with extension cables for each port of the pi, and by default they're all plugged into a case hole or limb

and you're free to 3D print your own replacement limbs, or even just pop them off

might even want a little mini ventilation hose and fan

I think each circle should be 2.5cm in diameter, with a .04 tolerance for movement (so an inch in diameter, is what I'm saying, and if you want your stuff to not be hinge-like you make it closer to an inch)

Or rather, thinking about it a little more, 40mm... with room to snap on a rig to attach a fan to the space. 40mm is a nice, common fan size, especially in 3D printing circles.

As for venting, looking at it, I'd honestly probably have to go for a textile wrap around a slinky-style spring, which is fine

## A thought

Oh man, it's like a piggy bank!

## a brainwave

oh my god... Kubernebabies

CYBERBABIES

I just went ahead and bought kube.pet, cube.pet, and cubie.pet

## oh my god

yes, absolutely, lean into this branding. It's like what if a Furby ran a Minecraft server. This could become *the* hot toy for indoor kids.

## inspiration

[this design that is iteslf patterned after the Trash Can Mac](https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/gadget/macpi-pro-tiny-v2-1-the_craft_dude)

these animals would have a sort of astromech / junkyard-robot vibe
