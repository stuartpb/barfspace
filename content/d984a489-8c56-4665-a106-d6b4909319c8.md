# printacle

this is my project to make an OctoPrint killer

## the latest 2020-06-01

This idea is starting to merge with a resurgence of Module Tree thoughts (see Cockpit)

## implementation notes

see [WebSocket-to-Serial Implementations](d0d9c829-a69a-49ea-a9cb-eedcb34cab21.md) for thoughts on how to structure that whole shebang

gotta look up the stuff about how Chrome OS does image swapping - that could maybe be generalized out to a tool for "define your module_tree loadout as an image" (though, really, doesn't this eventually just become Docker images and volumes?)

anyway, even the simplest partition swapper would be better than OctoPi's "back up your settings then re-flash the microsd"

note 2020-03-10 that systemd has made a thing for A/B partitioning
