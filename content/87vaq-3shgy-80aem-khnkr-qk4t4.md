# Tool Grate

This is the base I've been using for all my current experiments in [plotting on my Prusa](79mrz-rrwds-z98se-6a3yw-w984b)

TODO: Link the fan-clasping thing I based the initial design's measurements off of

My current prototype on this is a holder for Silhouette tools: do I already have a page for that yet?

## subdesign notes

## latest thought

Actually, for stuff like cutters, I think what I really need is just a rigid track holding the apparatus in place - no springs.

I'm actually not sure a mere plastic clip is enough to cut, like, cardboard.

This all stems from the experience where I tried to use my cutter to just cut some tabs for my Shenzhen I/O binder, and it couldn't even do that consistently
