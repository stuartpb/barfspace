# What I Can Do Having Gone Through Therapy

I don't remember what was supposed to go here. Sorry! I think it was something about how I'm actually smart enough to pull this stuff off, maybe something about frog people thinking IQ is a measure of capacity and not throughput.

I'll leave this page around in case I remember what I was going to put on it (the link prompt I wrote is "The culmination of seven years of therapy is that I can say the most stuck-up and stupid thing I can possibly imagine saying"

Oh, might it have been "you can't offend me"? This might have been the place where I was going to talk about all the self-destruct mechanisms, and how the show has *alllll* these fallbacks, and they combine with therapy...

actually, screw it, I've got some stuff in Google Keep, let me paste it here.

Er, actually, this is kind of bridged to the [Well of Souls][] material. I'll paste it there.
