# Barfspace Roll of Loose Notes

I'm going to try using this instead of Google Keep for a while.

heading ids that aren't numbers would also make sense as tooltip values, as a markdown rendering option

---

blackbeard's treasure public/private/secret three-layer personal disclosure classification model?

heck even just describing what a Blackbeard's Treasure gambit is would be cool

---

a thing I think about a lot is Chris Morris describing his career trajectory going from The Day Today to Four Lions being that he used to be really engrossed in the way people said things, and then he became engrossed in what was being said. I'm paraphrasing somewhat, but the way the maturation was framed really shifted somethign for me. this should probably be torn off and put somewhere in the vicinity of that "growing Up" / "The Deltas" angst-musing or whatever

how do I turn on "hitting the tab key indents the current line even at the end" in Ace? or Monaco?

---

octoprint feature: 3d printer alarm clock. At the given time, your bedside 3D printer plays a tune, then start preheating a print, which will then commence once preheating finishes. Want to sleep? You'll have to cancel this print. (or, you know, sleep through the print, but that'll be on you - the silent print moving around is enough to engage my ADHD ass and not want to sleep, I think)

END OF ROLL, PLEASE RE-ORDER
