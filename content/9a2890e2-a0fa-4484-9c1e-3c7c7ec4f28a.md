# The Method Lab

(Not to be confused with [the Arizona-based video production agency of the same name name](http://www.methodlab.com/).)

This is my home base for [methods engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_engineering) and that class of thing. [Time and motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_and_motion_study), things like that.

It's somewhere between Lean Notes protips, Projects, and Messays (especially the [big ones][] in which they share the original impulse of having dedicated repos created for them in the Pre-Notes Era of [My Old Bad Ideas][MOBI]), as well as the [Wellness and Fitness index][WAFI] and some degree of all the other stuff that's linked off from Right Now

[big ones]: e0fc507e-e5ec-4771-93ee-9b4d5bda3606.md
[WAFI]: 2087f1d7-55fa-4d8b-a4a0-01e4d8579047.md
[MOBI]: f3f3d6ba-6342-415a-9f3b-ab4f1d75a692.md

What gets drafted here: procedures, standards, guidelines... all that fun boring stuff

see also [Component Projects](cc2836d4-ad3f-4f0a-8974-981f8cc69b36.md), many of which can feel like abstract methods at times

- [Project HOARD](ab4e905a-db98-4ca2-a52d-93eaf8dc8ca4.md)
  - [2K19 Nexus](7b3283fd-ba8a-4fd9-a496-f4f50d31dba3.md)
  - [Baggage packing procedure](b1cc9089-e36b-4727-80f8-911c882d12d6.md)

Other stuff to be merged in there is listed in the repos leaning toward merging in under "Merging Versus Supporting Existing Works" list on the [Barfspace Operations][BOPS] page. (SACRED?)

[Extreme Open Notes](2f6140a5-b798-4f5f-a1c6-981f8bbf8aa1.md) is an offshoot specifically thinking about generalizing the structure around [Lean Notes](f00c3d23-8848-4bb4-8d7a-d009f7344374.md), currently kept here in case I ever move forward with that

BISNES/BIGDOG could probably be introduced here

[BOPS]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md

Kind of like this is the [household experience page][HousE], potentially - right now it's just a thing about dishwashing but that's still procedure-like

[HousE]: 4f20d294-9c5a-4f0b-913c-cbce172a0325.md

Specs I think make more sense in dedicated, structured repos, but there definitely might be a shadow nexus somewhere on here for unstructured thoughts on specs

at some point [my loadout system][Loadout] might be turned into some kind of template, which would go here.

[Loadout]: d9cb40c4-b0c0-49c4-94cc-5033dd9316f7.md
