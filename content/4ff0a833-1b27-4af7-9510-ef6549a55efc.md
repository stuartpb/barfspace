# On underpowered Raspberry Pi Nodes

I'm mainly worried about how my old RPi3 has only 2GB of RAM.

Ultimately, I figure I've seen people run clusters entirely on 2GB Pis (I think), and I'll have 3 other nodes in the cluster with 4GB RAM (the 2 Pi4s and the Chromebook). The Chromebook had issues when running as the master node, but those seem to have stemmed more from the master node only having two cores (and needing to run other things on the node, which isn't part of the design in the new system).
