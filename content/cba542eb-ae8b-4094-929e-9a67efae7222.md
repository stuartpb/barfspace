# LSC / Build / What's Next

I've been alienated from DSA, due to a lot of stuff, and it's like, why are we sticking around at this point? What is that getting us?

- LSC starts a "not in DSA" membership list, possibly in conjunction with that org we're currently sort of aligned with?
- Everybody who's currently building something around DSA now builds it expecting DSA to disappear.
