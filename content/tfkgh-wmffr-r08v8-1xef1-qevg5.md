# Angel Season 6 etc

I think there's something about my thoughts on this in *OneNote*, if I go back and look for it.

Of course, I know that Dark Horse had a comic for this, but I never read it beyond the ones that were published concurrent with the show's first season, which were lousy. I'm just spinning these off the top of my head.

The basics:

- Wesley, in dying, would be trapped in the same bureaucratic hell as Lilah, having made a deal with Wolfram and Hart to make Angel somehow able to win that impossible fight (possibly just staving off the forces of darkness - this idea could be developed)
- Wesley's deal, since Wesley had a *lot* of leverage against WRH that he pulled out in negotiations, was to *restore Fred's soul to Illyria's body.* He'd surprise Illyria with this - Illyria would note that Fred's soul was consumed when Illyria took posession of Fred's body, and Wesley would explain that an ancient being of Choas like Illyria should know that *anything* can be recalled From The Void, if you're willing and able to pay the expenditure, as he was
- Illyria would then become a God with an Identity Crisis: sounding like Illyria at times, sounding like Fred at others, and *hating* the idea that *she* could be *conflicted* with the *personality* of a *mortal* within her, *overriding* her godly intuitions.
- This is all just written with the understanding that these actors have all aged significantly enough that this'll probably never come back (though, ooh, what if it's an *anime*? the Star Trek Animated Series had a good rep), but Lorne legitimately is gone, and it's not just because Andy Hallett is dead. Lorne has always kind of represented the powerful, well-adjusted queer perspective on Angel, and I think a big part of that is letting someone who's not dying, but would like to be left alone, to *be* left alone.
- Similarly, Cordelia is gone.
- One of the themes in this continuation is that no superpowerful being (including *any fictional character*) can ever *truly* be killed - it's *story* that keeps them alive. Those god beings Angel gave his watch to, his connection to the Powers That Be who I believe I remember him finding dead on the floor at one point, are *totally still around* - the only reason they appeared dead that one time was because *it helped the story*. (It's the same reason they accepted *his fucking watch* as a tribute: their function is to just be a Deus Ex Machina, and do whatever they can to not make it *too* obvious to Angel that Angel's reality is a fiction.)
  - This also ties into the kinds of stuff I want to do in [Aneris][].
