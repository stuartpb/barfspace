# Plushu noise

Coming off of the "Refactor Plushu" quest in [the list][quests]: I started writing "Rethink how configuration happens. How would you want a tool based on Plushu to be installed?", and I realized I need to sit down and think about this.

(NOTE: I thought about this more after wrtiting it, the notes below just reflect my general direction, I'm now planning on taking it further)

So, generally speaking, what I'm thinking is that Plushu will run as a tool that operates according to the modules in the specified `PLUSHU_MODULES` (or maybe a `PLUSHU_MODULE_PATH`).

Another thing I'm thinking about this is that Plusku would really need to be pulled out... okay I've deleted some of the things I'm thinking, so I can get to that.

I guess the simplest way to put The big thing I've been thinking:

## Plugins should be renamed to Modules

I know, it's weird since the project's still going to be called Plushu, but we're doing a soup-to-nuts overhaul of the weird Dokkuisms in this. The name's just going to have to be a quirk of etymology.

And that's the dumb thing leading to the big thing because it brings me to what's on my mind: Plushu really needs to be reigned in so that it's just the *core* of this. Right now, "PLUSHU_" is put in from of a *lot* of things, and there's this whole messy system for specifying module configurations that's basically turned into me reinventing package management (which I never wanted to do), and, yeah, yuck.

So, basically, I'm going to break everything that's currently in "plushu" but not part of "core" and move it to Plusku. Then, with what's left of what's in core:

- The plugins management stuff will be jettisoned, probably to Plusku, see next section.
- plushook is gonna get merged into Plushu, because...
- The Plushu command itself will no longer be user-facing. The one thing this really breaks (the `commands` script used by the Git plugin for Plusku) can be fixed at a level higher up the script (there was always a wrapper script around Plushu for SSH anyway).

## Unmooring "plugin management"

"Plugins" can remain the name for the system that can manage a set of modules for the user as an overlay for the system's default modules.

The plugins plugin will be maintained as a separate thing that is only expected to do light lifting, and have some configuration for your use case. In fact, it might even just get moved into its own project... since it uses the Git lifting from Plusku, I'll just let it be "Plusku plugins"... but since I have an idea for how another system might use it... nah, I'll keep it "Plusku plugins" for now, and I'll keep them in separate repos, so other orjects can just import Plusku's repos for it.

## Another thing that needs to be its own thing

The whole "tool for a user" concept needs to be a completely separate thing from Plushu, and, like, Plusku expects it to be used as a layer
