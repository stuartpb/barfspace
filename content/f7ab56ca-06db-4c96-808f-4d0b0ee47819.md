# Kubernetes Notes Hub

Now that I've got an actual dedicated k8s control plane running, I can dive into Kubernetes in earnest.

I've stashed my old mess of notes [here](fe193832-2ffa-4cd4-a458-ec2c73cbe9b3.md): I was kind of absorbing documentation at random, and I've got a much more focused direction now.

EDITOR'S NOTE: Maybe that can re-become the home for structured research notes / unstructured reading notes? Now that I've got a few classes of note, and need subindexes for each

I'm aiming to rework it for that purpose now
