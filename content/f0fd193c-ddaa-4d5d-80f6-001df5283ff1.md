# Selling Bagtent

"Selling" in the sense of [Selling to Help](aed6ef5f-8318-472d-9c43-d86a5c26cb8b.md)

You've got this whole crazy system for structuring content, and you're using it like crazy, but you still haven't explained the *why* of this system to anybody, the *what* or the *how*.

- [ ] Don't forget about [How I'm Writing With Bagtent](13ceb37e-99d5-417b-be3c-ec7e1bc537ac.md)
- [ ] Link or merge this into [BISNES][]
- [ ] Write up an explainer on bagtent (ie. finish README)
- [ ] Identify strengths and weakness (ie. When It Might Make Sense to Use Bagtent)
- [ ] See if anybody would be interested in being a producer for bagtent (a la the [quest for "Requests for Producers"](49561f8d-d2d5-42b7-ac0a-d22683a1f0c3.md))
- [ ] Think about a logo or artwork for bagtent.
  - [ ] Look through your Tabalanche stash to see if you can find that picture of a failed 3d print where some of the pieces were partway printed, it was cool, and a good mood-board inspirational aesthetic for all this.
