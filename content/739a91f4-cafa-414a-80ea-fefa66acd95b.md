# Unusual Studio, But It's Local

So, this note's going to be my central point of operations for this whole consultancy thing I'm currently pursuing.

## TODO

- [x] Reach out to your first prospect.
  - [ ] You'll want to iron out your terms first.
    - [ ] Should there maybe be some kind of contract to sign?
  - [ ] You've... *kind of* done this, though they still haven't gotten back to you.
- [ ] Figure out some [initial terms][The Flow].
- [ ] Write up [an ad][] for Craigslist.

## not so much a "todo" but things that are thrashing around in my head

I should really figure out how to reconcile the Unusual Studio Projects list with people's ideas from this.

## Subnotes

- [An Ad][]
- [The (Local) Flow][The Flow]
- [Unusual Studio Quests][], for a hypothetical streaming side of this

## this is basically a note for unusual studio

I don't know where to put this, but the phase after "Viable" should be "No Longer My Thing", ie. the project has passed off to the point that someone else is working on it more
