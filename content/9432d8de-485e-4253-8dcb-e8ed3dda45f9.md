# bagtent braindump 2018

(note about needing a better meta system for bagtent/barfspace notes excised, as the [Bagtent top note][BTN] and [Department of Barfspace][DoB] have both emerged to fill this void, and the thought that needed to go in there has been filed accordingly)

[BTN]: ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md
[DoB]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

(a divergence on top-notes and sprout as a UI feature in a proper web editor was moved to the notes page for [borkflowy][])

[borkflowy]: a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md

(content here moved to [page explaining sprout and top-links][stl])

[stl]: 31396cb8-8b5e-4433-9174-c06b0bb0a9ed.md

I can also use `bagtent` to demonstrate how an ideal version of git's "[did you mean][]" would work

[did you mean]: b1bdad52-b669-4bf1-8708-6ef9d6dce47c.md

blip thought (originally in the middle of the sprout-menu/top-links digression): these notes are like the raw version of what my programs look like, like this is the primordial ooze, the egg whites of what I do: it's just a bunch of random thoughts that dictate the program's behavior, but there's no attempt to structure them - they define a consistent whole, but it's like getting snapshots of different parts of an elephant. Programming is the act of putting all those parts together.

(thoughts on bagtent style moved to [this page][styleguide])
