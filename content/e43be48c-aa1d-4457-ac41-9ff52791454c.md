# Booming and Quarantine

(Previously encapsulated on a card for [Community Cultivation](5ff993d7-333f-4a27-a46b-85a7878fb094.md), where it was tagged as "Protip", "External Link", and "Education".)

People will always want to express themselves *somewhere*, and the most effective way to keep them from doing it where you *don't* want it is to give them a way to do it *somewhere else*.

Think of it like booming an oil spill: http://www.dailykos.com/story/2010/05/11/865387/-Fishgrease-DKos-Booming-School

With booming, you can't keep *all* the oil away from the beach: instead, you set up pieces of plastic to direct it so *most* of it goes somewhere where you *do* want it (into a "catch basin" where you can deal with it).

## More thoughts on this

Since I originally wrote this, Reddit did this whole "Quarantine" thing (because, you know, all the problems that had been festering), and it eems like it might have been an effective use of this strategy in a final "eliminate" phase (where I guess everybody just went somewhere else)? hmm
