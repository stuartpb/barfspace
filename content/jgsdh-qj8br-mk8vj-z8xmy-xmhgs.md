# bagtent braindump 2018

this page aggregates concepts that were originally written in a mishmash brainstorm for [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3)

it's pretty much just a historical artifact at this point (for retrieving context to understand these disjoint writings) - see the bagtent index proper for a better-structured tree

- [bagtent-sprout and bagtent-top-links](64wps-e4bbs-2k92x-60dc5-v1afd)
  - [link suggestion dropdown](nypb9-qhzf4-ceaap-gx6rb-r11ec)
- [this idea about the uniqueness of footnames](fwyrz-f37q8-m790b-qsca1-0fmcf)
  - this was originally moved to a node for [style guide and best practices](e3x4r-3ch9f-js9m9-q1pf4-sax06)
  - it was moved out when [Inlining links](mkj61-12ak7-rea82-ks9qe-dqwer) supplanted it
    - the thought that caused that shift is archived as [Inline Rock](t2m2g-73fjy-r58h9-406ky-mz9re)
  - This swoopty-relinking in its referencing, and the way this actual described convention changed, should both be documented around The Oozy Sewer
    - I think the latter is at least somewhat remotely linked in
- [extending and enhancing the basic bagtent model](aef3a-jnj1v-p39qq-0msqd-cbkcp)
- [notes on mixing content types](pbddw-54adh-m39zp-sfrtt-420cc) (kind of interplays with "extending")
- [thoughts on "aliases" for short, fixed page names](dqydd-qshx5-pv9px-eqa2j-mavg8)
