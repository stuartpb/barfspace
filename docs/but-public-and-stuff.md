i love the idea of a blog where all the posts are just not even finished or in any kind of order and constantly changing, like even live-updating

but you need access to the history, because "why the fuck does it look like this" is such a common question when you've got a folder you've overwritten stuff in with no time blocked out to ensure you finish your thoughts / editing sometimes, where work goes for several years, you need to be able to put it into context to be able to pick the threads up again, that's what I've gotten out of GitHub

aside: this is why I FUCKING HATE when people think Git is a synchronization tool and not a VCS, it's like, they've never recognized the power of context that historical metadata gives you, they're blind to the larger narratives that inform DOING SMART FUCKING WORK

ok so if I go forward with that, I have to remember to... 

to update the README to explain what's going on. Phew, for a sec I'd forgotten what I was supposed to remember, which is The Worst Freaking Feedback Loop

Also should remember to set it up so it doesn't try to git commit when rebasing, which is gonna be TOTALLY NECESSARY if I decide I need to purge something I didn't want comitted from history (like if I just idly write swear words while I'm trying to remember what I was going to type and it pushes that and now everybody sees what a potty mouth I am)

(or really it's for when I'm worried that my earlier drafts would make me sound like an asshole and I don't want folks seeing them because, well, yeah, I don't like being misunderstood, that's totally My Thing, I've had enough therapy to accept that)

---

uh yeah I can always rebase so long as autocommitting is run by a stoppable daemon running in the console where I put my changes together
