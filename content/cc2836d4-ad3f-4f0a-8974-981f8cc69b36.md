# Component Ideas

This is a page collecting project ideas that make sense as a feature or enabling technology behind some larger system

It's like [Scaffolding and Frameworks](d78bdabf-6401-489e-a284-51c500826748.md), but from the other side

There's also some overlap with [Methods](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md) and [Spec ideas](623663c5-9130-48ca-a3a7-1a37e88d307a.md)

- [alphabinary](a92da7dd-0bba-44ba-8e5a-743571caab3e.md)
- [Hashblot and Hashsplat](92dc66f5-23e0-4790-ac34-6b18a76d0d98.md)
- [surpass / Gross Simplification](4abecfee-9100-45f3-9566-4d5234924dd2.md)
- [timewaiter](6f16c598-4c9c-4ba5-ad41-488662dcfcf4.md)
- [envigor](265f23de-445d-44d3-acfc-66e316cb03a2.md)
- [dym](b1bdad52-b669-4bf1-8708-6ef9d6dce47c.md)
- [dum](3c185b9f-9c22-492a-a6a4-5843e9addc13.md), a lean DOM-subset implementation
- chachacat

Note that I also have [a writeup series in the works](f1403399-a887-4262-aac6-292035465eab.md) for a lot of these.

## See also

- [Collaborative Content Collections](fa8952af-648f-4d3d-a1a7-39b052123911.md) can often underlie Features and Parts, the same way that these do

## Not mine, but in the same vein

A lot of Doug Crockford's stuff, like his Base32 spec (and JSON ofc)
