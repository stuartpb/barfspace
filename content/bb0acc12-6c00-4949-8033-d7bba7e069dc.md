# Sourcing More Raspberry Pi

Looking at all the stores on https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/?variant=raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb:

ended up going with PiShop

## passed up

and why:

- [CanaKit](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-4gb-board.html)
  - [4B](http://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-4-4gb-board.html)
  - [3A](https://www.canakit.com/raspberry-pi-3-model-a-plus.html?defpid=4457)
  - tries to upsell me on checkout, before it lets me update my shipping info
- [Chicago Electonics Distributors](https://chicagodist.com)
  - [4B](https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb?variant=29160194998351)
  - [3A](https://chicagodist.com/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-a?variant=15386068320335)
  - keeps adding bullshit shipping insurance to my order
  - offers a bunch of shipping options, all but "First Class Package" are more expensive than PiShop's Standard Ground

## knocked out of contention

And why:

- Adafruit
  - [4B](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4296)
