# ![Tag: Chapter Link][] Table A: A non-linear-but-paced flow

For people who like their hands-on work mixed with their planning.

I've never been much for "we'll spend this semester in the classroom learning about everything and then next year we'll actually touch something" classes. I like to have the context for everything in front of me as I learn it, so I can check that I understand correctly rather than building up a completely misguided fantasy in my head divorced from reality.

In other words, I'm not a fan of being told about *what there is to do* without being able to *do it*, so this table is laid out making sure you're set up to be able to *act* on each new section *as you get to it*.

## Finding Your Bearings

There should probably be some kind of Foreword here, but I'll defer to the statement immediately above, and the Introduction chapter below.

- [Introduction][]
- [Getting Something Started][]
- [Acquiring Hardware][]
- [Planning and Collaborating][]
- [Naming and Domains][]
- [Branding and Design][]
- [Acting in the Ecosystem][]

## Getting Set Up

There should probably be a statement at the beginning of this section as well: I think it was missing from the board iteration of this because this list was created mostly as a place for overflow after the first list got too crowded.

- [Codeless Solutions][]
- [Development Workspace][]
- [Computers and Phones][]
- [Enter the Web][]
- [Writing for Browsers][]
- [Building App Servers][]

## Building Things Out

Now we're cooking. At this point, you've covered the basic basics, and are ready to start bringing in the significant machinery.

- [Implementing User Accounts][]
- [Utilizing Databases][]
- [Testing and Automation][]
- [Hosting and Infrastructure][]

## Spreading Your Wings

Things are shaped up. At this point, your concerns are turned again outward, toward the world you'll embark into with what you've made.

- [Security and Preparedness][]
- [Email and Phone Numbers][]
- [Usability and Accessibility][]
- [Being Searchable][]
- [Observation and Measurement][]
- [Signal Processing and Reading][]

## Thinking Big

This is another list that I think was split off as overflow from the previous list without a lead-in.

- [Monetizing and Accounting][]
- [Manual Components][]
- [Community Cultivation][]
- [Spread Strategy][]
- [Launching and Releasing][]
- [Going International][]
- [Making the Rules][]
- [Beyond These Notes][]
