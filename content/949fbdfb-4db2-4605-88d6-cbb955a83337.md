# Built-in earbuds

You could do wired versions with the speaker mod, connecting as laid out in [Speaker case](83755943-b1f5-4e6a-abe2-913f318e7646.md)

Oh man, that would be an interesting alternative to speakers in the speaker mod: it has built-in retracting earbuds, and you can leave them in place to work as little open-air speakers.

But also, you could take a pair of cheap Bluetooth Earpod clones, clip the battery out of the case, wire the charing hardware to 5v, and have the earpods be integrated into the device case. this isn't your classic "point blank bluetooth" atrocity since the wireless hardware is in the earbuds anyway
