# kubernetes journey of discovery

## path of the tutorial

massive shoutout to Kelsey Hightower for giving me the giant insight "pods all run on the same host" that is really the thing I needed to start understanding this -- that plus the Concepts overview make up pretty much the bedrock of my engagement with all this

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/independent/install-kubeadm/

okay, my head is spinning, but https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/ is a *really* good introduction that is, like, exactly what I need, that isn't condescending "What are containers? What's a computer?" but actually telling exactly what I actually want to know, really :100: stuff

## subnotes

- [storage wars][stor]

honestly a lot of this page should be forked out to dedicated locations

## going through the Concepts pages

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/#addons oh okay, here's a thing I've been wondering that explains some stuff

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/#how-to-change-ownership-of-a-field-between-the-configuration-file-and-direct-imperative-writers all these instructions that are "to switch from one method to the other, stop using it like that" are clearing my pores

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/kustomization/ I think this is a little too deep for me before I read the other concept documentation? I was able to get pretty much everything up to this point, but this seems to get weedier and weedier to appreciate

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/object-management-kubectl/declarative-config/#defining-controller-selectors-and-podtemplate-labels I don't understand how this is connected to declarative config?

## exploring if there's a better way to do images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/ indicates that kubernetes doesn't really disrupt the docker image-registry paradigm, which sucks, and makes one of the current open questions with Plusku ("how should I do build images") all that much harder

cri-o suggests the possibility of other image formats at some point in the future so that's probably a point to watch

Might be possible to just run a registry "in-cluster" a la https://medium.com/@jmarhee/deploying-a-docker-registry-with-persistent-storage-and-local-only-access-on-your-kubernetes-1c6470d3611c

could also do "pre-pulling" for running an image built on the host which just sounds dicey and difficult https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#pre-pulling-images

If there's a better builder than the docker CLI, I don't know it's been built, but this seems to answer my question that Kubernetes has not come up with a better construction method than Dockerfiles

anyway Plusku should probably be using something more like Dockerfiles anyway

also, thinking now, maybe there'll be something like a "CI plugin suite" that has a specified directory to read as the Git root, and all the app plugins

also, new naming paradigm for Plushu: all plugins, instead of being prefixed "plushu", should be prefixed by the "project" whose philosophy they live under. so like the app-image-creation-from-git-hooks ecosystem should be one component, and the deploy-built-image-to-cluster should be another project that, like, kind of incorporates that?

## okay so here's one thing that can probably be better over images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/

## understanding k8s community / operations and API architecture

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api_changes.md

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/devel/sig-architecture/api-conventions.md

i live for this shit

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-versioning makes a lot of sense, I should consider conventions from this for the OPWS draft proposal pipeline

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/kubernetes-api/#api-groups is cool, versioning different types of definition differently makes sense and may be the way to go for OPWS (though probably not tbh)

the thing where there's a name and UID for each object, regardless of type, is... interesting

## kubesail corner

https://github.com/kubesail/deploy-node-app

also https://kubesail.com/ sounds pretty cool

## jot notebook for Clusterhood ideas

each server should have a different runtime/top-level distro, which probably maximizes feature support?

a frakti server seems like the way to allow for traditional VMs running arbitrary machine images, idk

ah, k, yeah okay so every user gets their own Namespace, and maybe we pre-populate that with a "starter" sub-namespace that has a registry pod for the user and other addon stuff like that (like a Heroku clone UI)

hmm, it seems namespaces can't nest? but one can make namespaces that are dotted, if I understand properly, meaning that you can still effectively subdivide a namespace?
