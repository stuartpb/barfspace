# bagtent link suggestion dropdown

by way of a blip in [the big bagtent braindump](9432d8de-485e-4253-8dcb-e8ed3dda45f9.md), later moved to [borkflowy](a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md)

I'm also thinking, like, every time there's a list and a link, do the search thing, and have "create (literal symbol)" as an option at the end to create a new page, which is inline-inserted

maybe have an extension that lets you open a new document (with a link to the current page or whatever) and works like the bagtent-sprout script, in that you have to pick a document to add it to (from a dropdown that sorts by pages with most inter-content links)

like, the thought I'm having right here, is, like, when there's an xkcd I like to pull out a lot, I can just type the name I usually use for it, and bam presto, there it is
