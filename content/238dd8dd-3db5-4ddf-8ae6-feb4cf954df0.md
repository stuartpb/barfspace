# built-in stylus case back

The push tab should be sized to pop neatly into the corner hole. also maybe the stylus length should run along the top

There should definitely be a string - a retracting hole for it, ie. with an inbuilt spring (like a badge holder), would be amazing (you could have the string run across the top and to the other side, allowing the spring mass to counterbalance)

You could have a "docking notch" for the string
