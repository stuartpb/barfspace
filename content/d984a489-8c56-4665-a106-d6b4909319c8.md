# printacle

this is my project to make an OctoPrint killer

## Subpages etc

- [best practice / pipeline for versioning printed models](b65a21d3-ed3d-41ac-aa22-122d551404ce.md)

## the key difference between printacle and octoprint

OctoPrint primarily models itself like a serial controller for the printer's axes

printacle primarily sees itself as a content processor that manages a cache of instructions on a FlashAir

## implementation notes

see [WebSocket-to-Serial Implementations](d0d9c829-a69a-49ea-a9cb-eedcb34cab21.md) for thoughts on how to structure that whole shebang

## link stash

https://blog.prusaprinters.org/prusaslicer-2-release/ documents a lot of cool stuff

https://plugins.octoprint.org/plugins/cancelobject/ is a thing mentioned there to consider: note that it uses comment metadata

https://github.com/paukstelis/Octoprint-Cancelobject for the implementation

## a thought on supporting stuff like cancelobject

we could upload the canonical code, check the printer's position, halt the print, upload a new version of the code, and start that (I don't think we can jump into a reworked fully-reprocessed file? so this wouldn't be a reusable file for if the same object got cancelled in a reprint of the file, but whatever)

this might just need direct control to modify the live commands, so it could just assume direct control from a position in the original stored data file, which is still an improvement

## another OctoPrint/printacle plugin idea

Is It Hot In Here, a plugin that notices if your heating-up print bed is displaying the thermal curve we'd expect if you left the build plate off and gently nudges you to check that
