# papercuts and other shit that's broke

## Stushiba (Arch Linux desktop)

Chrome has been hitching. Turns out it's because [it's processing every font on the system, for some reason](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=904994), of which I have like a thousand because I have the entire Google Fonts repository installed. Considering switching to Firefox until this issue is fixed. (Found through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/9wnur4/chromium_and_googlechrome_lag_problem/) Reddit thread.)

## Stutendo (Win 10 desktop)

completely fucked my password with no backups and the only recommendations online are all "lol, reinstall the OS entirely"

## miscellaneous broken plastic shit

- lid on my Brita pitcher
- clasp on this one backpack
- that pair of headphones that was uncomfortable
- the newer pair of headphones that won't stop buzzing
- both of those Bauhn earbuds, one way or another
