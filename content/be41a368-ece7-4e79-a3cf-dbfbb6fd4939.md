# Ultimate Secret Trump

I'm wondering how this could be framed: I'm thinking, instead of Liberal and Fascist parties, since each character follows the "party platform" somewhat loosely (they can lose even when their team wins, and sometimes vice versa), the parties are Democrats and Republicans, the policies are Democratic and Capitalist (the Democrats, of course, have a party platform that believes in Democracy, but most of them also want to enable Capitalism at least a little bit), and the positions are President and CEO.

## New Feature: The Mueller Investigation

After each turn, the table votes (one vote per player) on three players to investigate the party membership of. The top three picks are investigated together, with all their cards being placed on the table (but no distinction of which card belonged to which player) and their memberships are returned to their original characters by the game moderator (Putin).

In other words, the Mueller investigation is thoroughly empowered to reveal the truth to players about general allegiances that they pretty much already knew about.

## Characters

Unlike classic Secret Hitler, each player has a role with dedicated details:

### Mooch (R)

No matter which Party ultimately wins, Anthony "The Mooch" Scaramucci only wins by being Fired, so he can go off and build his brand (but, you know, he's not trying to suck his own dick about it).

After being Fired, Mooch must not announce that he has won until the game has ended (nobody's going to want to buy a book by the guy who wanted to be fired, after all).

### Manafort (R)

Paul Manafort loses if the Republicans win (causing him to be indicted after the election), or if the Democrats win before every player at the table has been a candidate for President at least twice (giving Manafort enough time on the campaign trail to grift up a nest egg).

### Clinton (D)

Hillary Clinton only wins if the Liberals win after three Capitalist policies have been put down (making Donald Trump a real threat to the American people, presumably one strong enough to hand Hillary Clinton the vote by default).

### Trump (R)

While lots of Republicans win by getting Donald J. Trump elected CEO of Capitalist America, Donald Trump himself can only win if he got to be *President* and enact at least one Fascist policy.

While this is a very difficult win condition, Donald Trump can always just ignore that he's actually lost, and tell himself he won.

### Bernie (D)

Bernie Sanders loses if Donald Trump is Fired. Bernie can only win if Democracy overtakes Capitalism through political means - even if you got rid of Donald Trump, that isn't enough to stop the rise of the billionaire class, the one percent of one percent.

(Considering that the win conditions of other Democrats generally involve either targeting Donald Trump or enabling Capitalism, this puts Bernie at odds with most of the other members of his team.)

### Schumer (D)

Chuck Schumer can only win if he's put down at least one Capitalist policy as President.

### Pelosi (D)

Nancy Pelosi can only win if she's put down at least one Capitalist policy as CEO.

### Jared (R)

Jared Kushner can only win if he's put down at least one Democratic policy as President.

### Ivanka (R)

Ivanka Trump can only win if she's put down at least one Democratic policy as CEO.

### Ryan (R)

Paul Ryan just plays by classic Republican strategy: wins if Capitalism overtakes Democracy or Donald Trump is elected Capitalist America's CEO, loses if Democracy wins or if Donald Trump is Fired.

Like his Democratic counterpart in Bernie, since almost every other Republican is following some kind of compromised agenda (including Donald Trump, who *cannot* lowball his fascist allegiances like a traditional Hitler), Ryan's game can be more frustrating than anyone.

### Podesta (D)

John Podesta loses if any Democrat (or, in a 5 or 6 player game, the policy deck) is directly investigated (ie. not as a figure in the ongoing sprawl of the Muller Investigation, but as a Capitalist Power to investigate directly) by a Republican President who is not subsequently killed.

As Podesta does not know who the Republicans are (whether his fail condition was met under a Republican Presidency will not be revealed until the game is over), this means that he will be desparately looking to kill pretty much any President that disagreed with someone he believes to be a trustworthy ally: a particular asset for the Republicans, if Fascism can advance far enough. (Or, you know, Capitalism, Fire, those euphemisms.)

### Manchin (D)

Joe Manchin loses if he is ever on a ticket that enacts a Democratic policy, unless he votes "Yes" on the vote that elects Donald Trump CEO (in which case he wins with the Republicans).

### Stormy (D)

Stormy Daniels gets to know who Donald Trump is before anybody else: after the Republicans close their eyes and before Donald Trump puts his thumb down, Stormy gets to open her eyes and see the little thumb sticking up for a couple seconds.

Stormy only wins if Donald Trump never gets to pass a Fascist policy (as President or CEO), or is Fired.

### McConnell (R)

Mitch McConnell can only win if the Election Tracker stalls three times, causing a policy to be enacted off the top of the deck without a vote.

### Cohen (R)

If Michael Cohen is ever Investigated (either directly *or* as part of the Muller Investigation), his win conditions flip to those of the Democrats.

### Christie (R)

Chris Christie distinguishes himself to the other Republicans during the night phase with a middle finger.

If all Republicans including Chris Christie vote the same way in an Election, Chris Christie can only win if he plays a Democratic policy between then and the end of the game. (If Christie plays a Democratic policy, then votes in agreement with the Republican bloc again, he cannot win unless he then enacts a *second* Democratic policy.)

After every turn, all players close their eyes, the Republicans open them, then after a five-second countdown (by the last-elected President, or Putin if available) take a secret silent vote on whether or not to keep Chris Christie. If a majority of the voting Republicans vote "No", Chris Christie leaves the table immediately, and loses as if he were Fired. (If the vote is tied, Christie stays.)

If Christie is eliminated in this secret vote, after everybody opens their eyes, the player who was Chris Christie must get up and leave the table immediately, **without saying anything** (just as he would after being Fired). The remaining players can ask if this player was Chris Christie, but all Christie is allowed to do is nod in response.

Once Chris Christie has been eliminated, if there are no other Republicans with a post-turn secret phase (like John Kelly), the Republicans no longer meet in secret after each turn (as there's nothing left to discuss).

#### Table Etiquette Rule

Because Chris Christie's win/lose condition requires tracking a large number of votes, everybody should make sure everybody else at the table has had time to review every player's vote every time, possibly by going around the table and announcing their vote individually.

### Franken (D)

Like Chris Christie, Al Franken reveals his identity after the night phase, and has a probationary presence at the table that all the players present vote on. As a Democrat, Franken reveals his identity to *all* players, and is voted on by Democrats and Republicans alike.

However, Franken does not get to vote on Elections, and if he is elected President or CEO, must discard his policy at random. Franken *does* get to see what policies he has been handed (and, if President when a Capitalist policy is enacted, gets to choose how to enact the policy), but they must be shuffled face-down by the other member of the ticket before he picks.

### Kelly (R)

John Kelly distinguishes himself to other Republicans during the night phase by pointing down at the table.

After each turn (after the vote on Chris Christie, if present), John Kelly can choose to swap one of his voting cards with any other Republican (he gets to pick which cards).

For the purposes of simplicity and clarity, Kelly may not swap two Yes cards or two No cards (as that doesn't functionally do anything, and would just be a risky and/or petty waste of everybody's time).

If a Republican is eliminated (including Chris Christie, who is silently voted on before John Kelly makes his trade), Kelly cannot trade with either of the voting cards they leave behind.

#### Table Etiquette Rule

To avoid exposing which players are Republicans when John Kelly is in play, all players must take care to not show more than one voting card face up. *The secret ballot process must be kept sacrosanct!*

#### Somewhat Small Tables suggestion

Before the post-turn night phase required when John Kelly is in play, everybody at the table puts their voting cards in their hand, pinched between the thumb and forefinger. The player who is John Kelly should put the card they want to switch with another Republican at the bottom, face-down, so that, when the Republicans open their eyes, Kelly's card can be seen, and Kelly can reach out to swap it with the target Republican

Reminder that everybody at the table must do this, even if John Kelly has been Fired, since the Democrats don't know who John Kelly is.

#### Somewhat Large Tables suggestion

If not everybody at the table could potentially reach everybody else, but enough people could reach more or less within each other that it wouldn't be too much of a giveaway (and not so close that the movement involved wouldn't be too much of a giveaway itself), the swap can be done by having each person swapping cards (indicated by Kelly raising his card and nodding toward the Republican the card will be swapped with) place the card being swapped somewhere that they can reach: then, after all players open their eyes, they swap the positions of the two cards, then close their eyes again so the two players swapping cards can reach out and pick up the now-swapped cards.

### Booker (D)

Cory Booker is subject to a running Bipartisanship Score, and can only win if he has more votes on record agreeing with the players to his immediate left and right than *disagreeing* with the players to his left and right. (If Booker has an equal number of votes agreeing *and* disagreeing with his neighbors, he can not win.)

If the two players disagree on a vote, then the score does not change (as either way, Booker's vote agrees with one and disagrees with the other, cancelling each other out): however, if the two *agree*, Booker's Bipartisanship Score either goes up or down by 2, based on whether his vote matches theirs.

If the player to his left or right is eliminated, Booker's Bipartisanship Score now goes up or down by 1 *every turn*, based on whether or not his vote matches the remaining player on the other side. (His Bipartisanship Score still runs starting from whatever total was amassed when both players were present.)

If the player to Booker's immediate left *and* right are eliminated, Booker is finally free, and is no longer subject to this restriction (even if he'd voted against both of them every time, he can still win).

### Rudy (R)

Rudy Giuliani is subject to a running Partisanship Score, and can only win if he has more votes on record agreeing with Donald Trump than disagreeing with him. (If Rudy has an equal number of votes agreeing *and* disagreeing with Trump, he can not win.)

### Palin (R)

Sarah Palin can only win if she has been a candidate for CEO at least three times.
