# Right Now: Anything New, Exciting, or Different

This is a page pointing to pages for stuff that's on the forefront of my mind, sort of like an "open tabs".

I last overhauled this page at the end of June 2019: [here](4af24c31-8b8f-4278-af40-262389fbf415.md) is a snapshot of most of that content.

I've moved it into a subpage to copy/retrieve from, as much of its content was dedicated to my switching away from GitPod to edit these notes (written in a frantic hurry to commit before I ran out of time).

## Writeups

I'm making moves to get started writing [articles on some of the stuff I've invented](f1403399-a887-4262-aac6-292035465eab.md).

## The job thing

I'm waiting to hear back from two companies and, other than that, am kind of... stuck, idk.

## Firefox

In light of all the crap that's starting to happen around Chrome, I'm [moving to Firefox](7b0f829a-7fbe-4896-9b5d-8196e1bca2a4.md).

In doing so, I'm revisiting my old [Browser Extensions](55f979e1-71e9-40db-aad2-34418ec7bb5d.md).

## Wedding stuff

I developed [lumpkin](93fce556-92a2-4e8b-8005-1e8455abec91.md) for sending out our Save the Date emails, and will likely be hacking on it further to send out future wedding correspondence (like invitations).

## Alphabi

Just imported some pages from my [alphabi](a92da7dd-0bba-44ba-8e5a-743571caab3e.md) workspace

## Maker stuff

I've got these plastic clips holding a WS2812 strip on my desk. I intend to use this for some kind of productivity tool, but am currently stalled on not having the resources to dedicate a NodeMCU chip to running it.

Reminder here: it's supposed to be about reminding me to take a breath and meditate. Seeing how stressed out I've been lately, I think this is pretty important.
