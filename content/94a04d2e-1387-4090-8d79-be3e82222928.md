# Repos with nice writing

This is an adjunct to the [June Judgment](b7b835c5-d843-4888-ae53-bd8aef36d5cd.md) for repos that aren't *content-centric*, but are still content-heavy, or at least rife with good, polished content. (In other words, a showcase.)

I only really ended up listing two repos here... oh well.

## Project Araminta

[Project Araminta](https://github.com/stuartpb/project-araminta) has a good README: the tenets of SACRED were on my mind when writing it.

## opws-testaccounts

Okay, this isn't *nice* writing, but I do think it could be merged into the notes, with the spec for "what a test account should look like" worked into a Firefox extension that uses containers to make this even smoother (and maybe exportable!)
