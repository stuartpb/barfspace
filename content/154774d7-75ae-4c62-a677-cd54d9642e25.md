# The Clock realtime threading graph visualization model for Mastodon

What if you put all messages in a ULID-like space, then had them splay out via rotation around a relative clock?

Like your screen is the rim of a circle

and each node has replies spiraling off of it

so each toot is like its own little galaxy

and I call this MAstodon but it's part of the general "interlinking document graph model"
