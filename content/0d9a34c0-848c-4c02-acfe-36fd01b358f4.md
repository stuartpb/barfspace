# The Core Cuteness of Cubie.Pet

one thing that I think should be dictated about CubiePet is that it's user-friendly by being acessible for everything

the core idea I wanted to convey here is "these cubiepets can be used to illustrate all kinds of things in tutorials and documentation"

like how the storage banks work

so yeah, I want Scott McCloud style "manuals" that are comics, like the Google Chrome Comic
