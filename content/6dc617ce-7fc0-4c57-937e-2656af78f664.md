# WS2812 Necklace Brainstorming

So, one of the things I'd like to have in this design is functionality so that every bead can be removed without having to resolder/rewire anything.

Each pearl can contain a 2020-form-factor WS2812

My thinking now is that each "bead" assembly will actually contain two half-beads.

Now, the *simplest* way would be to have each "bead" be a half-sphere, with each soldered piece containing a front half and a back half. That might be the direction initial development will work with.

However, the *fun* stuff would be to have each bead-assembly be most of a hollow bead with the LED sitting on an outer shell (forming two-thirds of the "bead"), and all the bare wires running through an inner ball to the next "bead". This would hide the wires, which seems like a good enough idea to solve one of the things I've been worried about: causing a short by having the bare wires twist. (They could also be insulated, but who wants that hassle?)

My new thought is to continue with the "front half / back half" idea, like clasping Lego hands: a "disc" that's like a C, wired to a "clasp" that contains all the wiring to contact the next piece.

Anyway, the question of how to do the connection solderlessly remains. My idea is to solder each terminal to a wire with a 1mm stainless-steel bearing on the other end.
