STUSIE
Well, you know, I wasn't really trying to follow any kind of template when I wrote that scene.
(beat)
But, hey, now that I look at it...
(recounting the first four steps on her fingers)
it totally fits!
(counting a couple more)
He even pays a heavy price! *Literally* heavy!

LEA
Is that what you were going for?

STUSIE
No.

LEA
So where *did* this come from for you, then?

STUSIE
Well... I don't know if I really would have been able to put a finger on it back then. And, I mean, now, I'd obviously say "being trans", and there's definitely an element of that that I recognize in hindsight, but, like...

STUSIE puts her laptop to the side and leans forward.

STUSIE
It's something bigger. I feel like our lives are so full of these things we're supposed to do, supposed to be. All this ritual and pomp and circumstance meant to make you feel like fifty generations of humanity built an inescapable maze, just for you.

LEA
Like gender.

STUSIE
Yeah, like gender. And, yeah, like gender, it's a bunch of fucking bullshit that you can really just straight-up ignore. Like, in this scene, I was trying to evoke this feeling that, like, if you don't have this absurd, elaborate artifact, you're not just unworthy, you're being *disrespectful* to, like, this whole elaborate legacy, you know, all the kingdoms, thousands of generations - you know, the way JK Rowling talks about capital-W Womanhood.

LEA
Like it's something out of Harry Potter?

STUSIE
Like it's fucking Hogwarts! Like there's this magic key, and if you don't have it, you know what? You don't *deserve* to go through this door. This is the Sacred Lock. How dare you even *think* of opening it.

LEA pumps her fist in the air.

LEA
But he picks the lock!

STUSIE
He *picks* that fucking lock! There's a *literal gatekeeper*, standing *right there*, and he goes "I don't care if I don't have this thing you're telling me I need. I'm crossing this threshold."
