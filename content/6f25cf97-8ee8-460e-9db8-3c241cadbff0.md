# My Life in Quests

Referring to Stuart P. Bentley (mostly) in the second person, as one would expect from a quest tracker (as opposed to much of the rest of the writing around here, which refers to Stuart P. Bentley in the first person, singular or plural).

I've grouped them into categories like "Arcs" and loose quest categories: I think that kind of matches how they look in my head right now. I'm thinking specifically of how Crashlands did quests - everything you see here is something you're currently able to pursue, and what comes next can be a surprise once you have it.

"Plans" that aren't broken down into constituent paths that are mostly-non-blocked (ie. conjectural plans) are distinguished by a `[?]`, indicating that they're expected to be added once the previous objective{is,s are} completed.

There's some relationship to obtainables to be had in the branch/leaf nodes, but I'm not sure what it is. Perhaps there's something philosophical to be gleaned about what is phrased in terms of obtainables and what is not.

## The Barfspace Arc

Filling this page out is, in itself, part of a larger arc of communicating and understanding your internal state.

### And What Is Your Quest?

### Dividing Up the Old World

Barfspace has essentially grown to encompass most of the previous failed projects I'd meant to do writing on.

- [ ] Close stuartpb.plan.
  - [ ] Remove plan.md itself.
  - [ ] Rewrite the README to point to barfspace
  - [?] Archive the repo.
- [ ] Revisit the list from when things were first being merged into [Lean Notes][] (when bagtent was first being devised).
  - [ ] Figure out a litmus test for the difference between Meditations and Musings, or merge the former (in Lean Notes) into the latter (here).
  - [ ] Merge pitches-and-scripts into here, where it's less embarassing (since there's a sort of ambient embarassment about the place here).
- [ ] Work out what the plan is going to be for developing Lean Notes.
  - [ ] Honestly, at this point, shouldn't it be `lean-notes`? Even though it doesn't match the .com?
- [ ] Take some territory from [petlogs][].
  - [ ]

[Lean Notes]: https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes
[petlogs]: https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes

### Dividing Up the New World

I guess this'll probably be the canonical Sisyphean labor for not just trying to give structure to barfspace,

### Owning Your Own Words

Should this really be called barfspace? That makes it a very "separate" project, and it's really transformed into something very tightly enmeshed with your identity; even Test Track 4 (which was your email address's domain name for a solid *decade*) became an uncomfortable side-brand, and that didn't even have "barf" in the name.

- [ ] Rename this repo to something else.
  - [ ] I've been thinking "notes.stuartpb.com", pretty much: keeps things from looking like I want anything here to be any sort of long-term publishing destination.
  - [ ] Figure out what to do with all these lingering references to "barfspace" around.
    - [ ] Turn them into links to an [explainer page][]?

[explainer page]: f5d72b81-ccb9-45d0-8029-be70895f65ca.md

### Getting to Know Your New Bagtent

You've got this whole crazy system for structuring content, and you're using it like crazy, but you still haven't explained the *why* of this system to anybody, the *what* or the *how*.

- [ ] Write up an explainer on bagtent (ie. finish README)
- [ ] See if anybody would be interested in being a producer for bagtent

### Developing Your Bagtent Tools

- [ ] Start moving on some of what's outlined in [bagtent plans][].

[bagtent plans]: ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md

### Barfspace CI

Remember back when Barfspace auto-committed, and how you've stopped running it in the migration to bagtent because you don't want the repository committing with unreachable posts? Let's fix that.

- [ ] Write the bagtent-orphans script.
- [ ] Add a feature to the shotclock script that lets it hold off on running the shotclock when a test command fails.

## 3D Printing Upgrade Arc

Most of the quests in this arc are independent.

### One Less Resistor in the Circuit

You've been paying Amazon retailers for filament of unknown provenance for too long. Pretty soon, you'll have paid the entire cost of what one of these machines would have cost to buy (if you haven't already): for that, you probably could have extruded it yourself for a third of the cost. (It'd probably be for the best to not try doing the math on that until you can safely put those days behind you.)

Completing this quest will unlock Fully Reliably Reproducable Print Recipes, where the entire construction of a print, from chemical form to extrusion, is fully documented, and can be altered independently.

It will also unlock full material and color control, including reuse of recycled material as a component.

It will also unlock significantly cheaper filament on demand.

- [ ] Get a Filastruder Kit.

### Multi-Material Upgrade

Remember when you bought that whole goofy Replicator 2X clone because you wanted to be able to print multiple materials? And then it turned out that dual extrusion is a massive headache to work with? And then you bought this MK3 because this seemed a lot more like how you were thinking you'd expect multi-material to work, and you were getting all these different kinds of material that you'd like to swap more readily between anyway, and yeah your printer's really incomplete without this.

- [ ] Get the Multi-Material Upgrade Kit
  - [ ] Place an order from the Prusa store (maybe wait and see if there's a deal on Black Friday?)
  - [?] Wait until your order ships, some time next year.

### Sharpiecore

There's a recipe for [using Sharpies to color filament](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:312327) on Thingiverse, but you can think of some enhancements that would make this better...

Completing this quest will unlock Sharpie Print Colors.

- [ ] Thread some PLA through a cored Sharpie.

### Retooling

There are some cool tutorials about how you can rework your Prusa as a plotter or laser cutter. Maybe you could do something like that...

Completing this quest will potentially unlock 2D Plotting, 2D Cutting, and Laser Etching.

- [ ] Redesign the Prusa's X carriage to more easily detach from the extruder assembly.
- [ ] Redesign the Prusa fan bracket to clip into the extruder assembly without screws.

### The Little Dimmer

Your printer's backlight was too dim, so you fixed it by introducing a trimpot to the LED circuit - but isn't there a better way?

- [x] Order a new RepRap Discount board and a bag of sockets.
- [x] Fix the RRD board to work with your Prusa by flipping the pin housings.
- [x] Test that fix by running a print or two with the board.
- [x] Cut the trace to the backlight.
- [x] Epoxy a socket to bridge the connection through a custom circuit.
- [x] Solder the socket.
- [x] Place a trimpot in the socket.
- [x] Print new parts for your modified board in translucent PETG.
- [ ] Make a refined version of the dimmer circuit that's more sophisticated than a trimpot just sitting awkwardly in a socket on the board.
  - [ ] Complete the "A Little Jig" and/or "Better Than a Breadboard" quests to unlock the techniques necessary to run the circuit off a small ESP8266 (so it can be IOT-controlled).

### A New Stack

Pshh. This 3D print software isn't so impressive. You could do all that, easy.

Completing this quest will potentially unlock all sorts of inventive new 3D print features, specifically around having print jobs execute from SD directly from your slicer (which could be web-based).

- [ ] Look at the Slic3r codebase to see how hard it'd be to port to JS.
- [ ] Complete the "Refactoring Plushu" quest to have a decent basis for an OctoPrint replacement.

## Maker Quests

Most of these quests are independent, though some may depend on 3D Printing Upgrade Arc quests to progress.

### Better Than a Breadboard

You know, as cool as it is to be able to wear it like a morale patch and have the screen displaying stuff with the chip bare next to it, it'd be nice if you could use this breadboard for other stuff.

- [ ] Design a copper-tape-based socket-mount assembly to connect an ESP8266 to your ILI9225.

### A Little Jig

Well, drat. It turns out you can't just loop the copper tape around the pins.

- [x] Design an initial prototype for a copper-tape-based jig for flashing surface-mount chips.
- [ ] Figure out a way to make this jig capable of holding pins in contact.
  - [ ] Wait, couldn't you just put the tape by the outside, then wrap it a second time, so it's bound to the outside of the first layer?

### I Love Lamp

You know that bulb in a socket you've just had sitting in top of your shelves? Might want to do something with that. What you've got right now is probably a fire hazard.

- [ ] Print a test parallelogram prism to see if you've measured the dimensions of your shelving slots correctly.

### The MagicBand Infinity Gauntlet

Okay, so, yeah, [someone else already did this](https://www.thingiverse.com/make:545330), but you've got that yellow MagicBand Icon just sitting there, and it *is* the perfect size, shape, and color for the Mind Stone, and it looks like their thing wasn't worked into the print (and either way, they didn't publish their sources)...

- [ ] Make a version of the Infinity Gauntlet with a space for a MagicBand icon.

### The Calling Card

- [ ] Model your hat.
- [ ] Try out that "Oscard" action figure on a card.

### The Jackson Vive

You'd like to have a better system for keeping your Vive attached to your head, but you don't want to shell out the $100 for a Deluxe Audio Strap. Something $20 is more your speed, and you've already bought all the parts for it.

- [x] Design a new model for the headgear in OpenSCAD.
- [ ] Add supports under the tabs and print a unified piece for the bracket in PETG.
- [ ] Commit and push the latest design for headphone arms.
- [ ] Continue refining the headphone arm design for PETG.

### A Good Roll of Tape When You Need It

Not only this roll of double-stick tape on your desk, but copper tape, too!

- [x] Design a tape holder in OpenSCAD.
- [x] Print a first prototype of the design.
- [ ] Add a spacer to the inside for keeping the roll of tape away from the sides, so it can turn freely.
- [ ] Develop a cutting-edge system for cutting the tape.

### The Very First Thing

Oh, right! You've been so occupied by all this other print stuff that you forgot [the very first thing you wanted to 3D print][toothless-gsc]. Your original design was okay, but you can almost certainly do better today...

[toothless-gsc]: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:13307

- [ ] Sketch out the design for a grid holder (maybe in Model Magic).

### A Spring Thing

You've got some ideas for parts that'd require springs. Maybe there's a way we can make them?

- [x] Print a spring spooler from https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:92266 in PETG.
- [ ] Print a version of the spooler with a hole for a servo motor axis.
- [ ] Get a servo motor working by button control (possibly with potentiometer for speed) using an ESP8266 or ESP32.

### Project Araminta

Welp, it turns out the sources for the original stamp you were going for were online right about when you got started. Bummer.

- [ ] Design a stamp pad.
  - [ ] Design a cutting jig for inking stamps.
  - [ ] Order a stamping sponge.
  - [ ] Order a stamping ink.
- [ ] Design a self-inking stamp with guide.
  - [ ] Complete the "A Spring Thing" quest to unlock filament springs.
- [ ] Design a "clip" for raising twenties to be inked, one after another, in rapid succession.
- [ ] See if anybody's competently modeled dollar bills in SVG under Creative Commons yet.

### Finding the Plot

You've got these cheap stepper motors: what better inaugural project to start these out with than trying to build a plotter on the ESP8266?

Completing this quest unlocks Big 2D Printing.

Completing this quest will open the door to unlocking Stencil and Vinyl Cutting, as well as potentially Laser Cutting.

- [ ] Look at existing 3D Plotter designs.

### Who Go Weaving?

You've got some ideas that could use fabric, but you're not one for sewing. Even something that can just make competent straps would be useful, but something that could print a rounded sheet would be incredible.

- [ ] Read more about 3D Weaving, specifically what's open-source and available.

### A Light in Your Belly

Your Steven Universe costume could be more... inventive.

- [ ] Complete the "A Little Jig" quest to make the ESP-12S programmable without soldering pins.
- [ ] Design a gem that hold two LR44s, an ESP-12S, and an LED.

### Heart of Gold

You've got your silver one, but wouldn't you rather have one in gold? And one that doesn't slide open in your pocket?

- [ ] See if you can't design a version that clicks into place.
  - [x] Open Emmet's original SCAD file.
  - [x] Experiment with translating, rotating, and hiding the components until you understand the hinge enough.
  - [ ] Add a couple spokes at the Y extremes of the inner knob on LowerLeft.
  - [ ] Add a couple notches in the corresponding Y extremes in LowerRight.
  - [?] Print the new model.

### Crank the Pump

It's a pain in the ass to take your hydration pouch out of your vest just to toss a glass of water in, not to mention looking conspicuous as hell. What'd be nice would be if you had some sort of mechanism, one you could swap out for the mouthpiece, to siphon water directly from a source and put it into your pouch (or vice versa)...

- [ ] Print https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3063529 and see if you can figure out the assembly there.
- [ ] Model a hand-cranked 360-degree peristaltic pump in OpenSCAD.

### Hold the Caliper

**Complete!**

- [x] Print a holder for your caliper.
- [x] Stick the holder on some furniture and keep your caliper in it.

### Monorail!

- [ ] Look into potential monorail / trolley systems that could be printed.

### OGEL

- [ ] Review the structure of [LEGO.scad][] to see what can be reused for more complex components.

[LEGO.scad]: https://github.com/cfinke/LEGO.scad

## Repair Quests

We can rebuild them. We can make them better than they were.

### The Broken Headphones

These are still a perfectly good pair of Bluetooth headphones, it's just that the one hinge is broken. You know, that headband was never all that comfortable in the first place...

- [ ] See if you can get the headband disassembled for replacement.

### Let's Give You a Big Hand

- [ ] Search for big articulated hands on Thingiverse.

## Papercut Quests

Sometimes, it's the little flaws it feels best to solve.

### Slic3r PE and the Invisible Widgets

- [ ] Get to the bottom of https://github.com/prusa3d/Slic3r/issues/1323

## Will It Hack Arc

### I Don't Work Here

- [ ] Add a note to https://willithack.com/izon that you can't and won't provide support over email, and that questions must be directed to the issues page.

## Development Toolchain Arc

### A Nice Hex Editor

You know what would be nice? If most hex editors let you just easily define a format to visualize the bytes you're seeing in.

- [ ] Spec a JSON schema for Bytewise Abstract Sequence Trees (BAST).
  - [ ] Maybe look at Wireshark's structure for Dissectors.
  - [ ] Look at how minified JS / WASM do source maps for at least a few common parameter names/types.
- [ ] See what widgets there are out there for hex selection.
- [ ] Model the UI.
  - [ ] There should be N user-configurable panes, which can nest in tree structures if relevant, that are meant to display a cursor on the same data. Maybe there can be another interface for cursors.
  - [ ] for instance, "Bitmap View" (or "Indexed Bitmap View"), including by partial bytes (including single bits, if desired) would show all the bytes (given a certain alignment)
  - [ ] All UIs need to be ready to display and highlight any subsequence,
    - [ ] Specified in spans into the bits (but only by specifying eighths of a byte)
    - [ ] Must be able to illustrate selected / hovered spans
    - [ ] Cursor position (in terms of its own UI to sequences/positions, and in terms of visualizing a moving cursor position)
    - [ ] Things that lie on clean boundaries should be distinguished from the opposite
  - [ ] Views may be given invalid data: they need to figure out a way to visualize that as close to intelligibly as possible

### Kicking Off with Wayside

- [ ] Do a quick look-over of how `c9` does its stuff to see what lower-on-the-stack stuff can be shared.

### Refactor Plushu

[Plushu][]'s still a great system, but it's also still burdened by weird unnecessary assumptions about its environment that kind of melted on from being a lift from so much of Dokku.

- [ ] Split the Plushu core into multiple component parts.
- [ ] Move all the existing Plughu plugins to their own project.

[Plushu]: 10cfcf6f-df6f-4f83-9f17-6a43a43c15e6.md

## Quadration Arc

### The First Timetrain

- [ ] Get the C quadrator up and running on Abe.
- [?] Measure Abe's quadration rate.

### The Case for Abe

- [ ] Build an OpenSCAD encosure for Abe.

## Desktop Quests

### Label Me

You've got your label printer running in Linux, but it's... awkward. You're still not sure how to reliably print on the entire width of a label.

- [ ] Try OpenOffice.
- [ ] Write your own printing program that works just like you wanted it to in the first place.
  - [ ] Bring up the documentation for the printer's USB protocol.
- [ ] Buy a new, simpler printer.

### Fixing Avahi

Oh hey, wasn't there something about enabling the `mdns` resolver causing these massive hitches you've been seeing in Chrome? And why haven't you been able to resolve any .local addresses, anyway?

- [ ] Revisit

### Getting to Know Nix

You know, there are ways to have Nix eat an existing Linux installation. stushiba has a lot of cruft built up in its run environment, and between this and stuzzy (and potentially sturling), it's starting to be a bit like a monoculture. Maybe it's time to make the switch to a system with fully declarative configuration state?

- [ ] Look into what'd be involved in replacing the Arch installation on stushiba with Nix.

### Fancy LAN

You know what'd be nice? If there was some kind of DNS resolver running on the network for NetBIOS and mDNS names on the local network (and potentially letting these systems be addressed via an external domain name) so that you don't have to keep accessing OctoPrint via an IP address.

- [ ] Look into reflashing this router for OpenWRT.

## Comfortable Browser / Windowing Experience Arc

### Tabalanche Revamp

- [ ] Rework the visuals for Tabalanche.
- [ ] Make it possible to collapse tab groups into one "row of tabs", like they are at the top of the window.
- [ ] Make it possible to drag tabs.
- [ ] Make undo history visible.
  - [ ] See if the PouchDB Changelog can be used for a client to see its own previous changes.
- [ ] Add persistent / per-invocation drag-and-drop tag lists.
  - [ ] Have the lists be resizable on the fly.
  - [ ] Have Select Tag, Persistent / Quick Access Suggestions (Pinned), This Invocation Tags, and Persistent Tags in that order (probably top-to-bottom)
    - [ ] Select Tag is "Recent / Popular Tags" by default (maybe it's a mix by default, with the option to use only one or the other as... a slider?)
    - [ ] Filter textarea at top, like the Omnibar
      - [ ] Use this as a basis for Omnibar integration? This might become a separate quest
    - [ ] Arrow keys up/down move out of the filter area (maybe only from end of text, for users without Home/End) and into the suggestions
- [ ] Add search filter for tabs and tab groups.
  - [ ] Filter has the same kind of tag suggestion interface as stashing tabs, collapsible.
    - [ ] Checkbox turns on or off whether all tags matching the filter are included; it's on by default (but disableable in two clicks).
    - [ ] Tags can also be blacklisted.
    - [ ] Any tags moved to the "This Invocation" are cleared when the textarea clears (by Clear button or not)

## Reshaping Security Arc

### NilPass Modular Interface

- [ ] Work on https://github.com/nilpass/nilpass/issues/7
- [ ] Work on https://github.com/nilpass/nilpass/issues/8

### NilPass Storage

- [ ] Work on https://github.com/nilpass/nilpass/issues/6
- [ ] Work on https://github.com/nilpass/nilpass/issues/9

## Network Neighborhood Arc

### praisefiles

- [ ] Review the state of praisefiles as a workspace for a refresher.

### Request for Producers

- [ ] Make a first paragraph or two writeup.
- [ ] Gather up some projects I'd like producers for, and why, and what'd be involved, and how, etc.

### Clusterhood

- [ ] Find somebody who would like to run and/or pay for a server for [this][clusterhood].

[clusterhood]: 9664b592-59ed-4ac5-bf15-9b67f67af111.md

### FLOC Estimation

Figues in Lines of Code (also known as Fermi-Line-of-Code) Estimation is a way of measuring how much effort will be involved in implementing a feature or fix. It is based on [Fermi Estimation], and puts a neat easily-communicated metric of estimated effort on communicating milestones.

- [ ] Fill out https://github.com/stuartpb/floc-estimation

### LITL License

The LITL License is a short declaration of principles that serves the social purpose of a license, if not the full legal protections of one.

- [ ] Find a producer for https://litl-license.org/
  - [ ] Progress in the "Request for Producers" quest to continue.

### Buy Nothing

- [ ] Complete the "Fuck Facebook Fridays" quest to make Facebook use tolerable again.
- [?] Join the Buy Nothing group for your area.
- [?] Get rid of this old vacuum cleaner that's taking up space.

### Fuck Facebook Fridays

Face it: if you want to make things happen socially, you're going to have to start using Facebook again. At least you can actively fight it while doing so.

- [ ] Draw up a persistent document explaining why one should practice Fuck Facebook Fridays.
- [ ] Solicit suggestions for highlight topics.

## Unusual Studio Arc

It would be cool if you could just go online and show people the things you're up to. (Oh, well, I guess this page ort of counts, but something a bit more live than that.)

### Test Run

- [ ] Take on one of these other quests on-stream.
- [ ] Start using Quests here as TODO items on the Projects page (or start moving quests here to places that'd be more appropriate)?

### Quest Structure

- [ ] Spend more time with this Quests structure before making further plans to integrate it into Unusual Studio.
- [ ] Maybe it would make sense to sort these "Quests" under both Arcs and Projects?
  - [ ] Allow users to vote / pay in at any level, and funds will be divided up beneath that somehow (evenly?)
  - [ ] The infrastructure to associate Projects to Quests is already in place (the "TODO" link points to a document giving a project's quests, in one form or another)
- [ ] Not all quests should be Unusual Studio Quests. How would it make sense to draw that line?
- [ ] Find a way to associate odd jobs into Unusual Studio, if not by using Quests.
  - [ ] Quests also work pretty well as Agendas, just saying...

### Bluetoot the Loveable Sidekick

- [ ] Program a server that will make sounds out of a Bluetooth speaker on certain stream events.
