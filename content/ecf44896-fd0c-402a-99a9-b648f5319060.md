# Netlify's identity stuff

forked off from [the notes on Netlify CMS](b39d2df0-1da1-473e-99c3-e2e8b2beeb45.md) so it can go into [Identity Notes](64a52921-8c92-40bb-a0e5-16414cc96d18.md)

https://github.com/netlify/gotrue says it's based on OAuth2 and JWT

There's also this [Git Gateway](https://www.netlify.com/docs/git-gateway/) stuff
