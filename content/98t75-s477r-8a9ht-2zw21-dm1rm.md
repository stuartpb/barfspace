# Writing the Ship

A sink-or-swim story game about the thin line between Titanic tales of Hollywood tragedies (like *Waterworld*) and Hollywood blockbusters (like *Titanic*).

From day one, everybody nurtures two making-of stories in their head: one is the expos√©, the other a warm retrospective.

## Your Film's Fate

The make-or-break part comes down to whether your group is more interested in *the people involved*, or the *story they're building*.

## Influences

Books and games influencing the thoughts behind this game idea:

- The Disaster Artist
- Memo from David O. Selznick
- Fiasco
- Microscope
- Too Funny to Fail: The Life & Death of the Dana Carvey Show

## How to Start

One idea for picking who goes first is, keeping Progressive Stack in mind, seeing if anyone's got an interesting showbiz news / fun fact thing they'd like to share

example: did you know Station in Bill and Ted 2 came from a deleted scene heading lingering in a draft of the script, turning into a character?
