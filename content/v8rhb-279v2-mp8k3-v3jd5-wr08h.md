can incorporate references to specific endeavors as examples, and incorporate artifacts. This covers everything outside these notes: work put together outside this tree since its creation is documented in cooperation with [The Beyonder Consulate](w72r2-yzcwa-01a5f-1fwvr-85ay7)

And, of course, this page is as much about how my content model is *evolving* (or at least it should work in lockstep with that thinking), because [News is History](7sngb-gkwtw-53b2v-snx0e-88hsr)

- [The Tomb of the How-i-roll Repo](qfntb-snnda-gx9ah-w284r-hwz8j)
  - A stub for the repository that came closest to trying to present what this page does, at one point in time
- [this node](krj3r-7ac6y-w99v9-f6x54-zjrrx) describes how I used to roll on GitHub, and was the one salient part to have ever been produced under how-i-roll that wasn't, in hindsight, unrelated (finding a far-flung location within these notes)
- [this node on continuations from OneNote](gwra9-1vx56-8sa35-twj2y-r7qw2) developed in conjunction with the [Deep Note Divers](nkn3z-e2b1m-weaxz-9teq7-d9w42)
- [How my approach to "Help Wanted" is evolving](4v6xp-bjnha-5mabx-mcg0r-0sag1)
