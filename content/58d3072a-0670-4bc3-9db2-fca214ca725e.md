# Weird ways to smuggle data

*(EDITOR: This overlaps the Big Blob of Data arc on Quests)*

[Steganography][] is something I think about a lot. I don't think I'm ever going to be able to top [Alphabinary Encoding][https://alpha.bi/], which, as far as I'm concerned, is a force of nature that I was merely able to unearth, but there are other isomorphic vectors for information transmsission that I think about when trying to convey the futility of small censorship.

Basically, I wish there was as much of a community around weird forms of steganography

- Conjectural tournament brackets. Not only can you smuggle N-1 bits in a bracket of N teams (and potentially exponentially more if you start allowing for things like scoring conditions and ties), but if you accept any arrangement of teams against each other, you can encode potentially hundreds of shannons (my original math said nearly 400, but I think that's not accounting for certain classes of symmetry). There are probably enough football leagues across Europe to exchange an entire RSA key each season.
