# The Deadspinning

This was in a dream I had: I couldn't tell if it was an FPS or a party, but if you turned your back, like the spies in TF2 or Werewolf, a Vampire could turn you by "uncloaking" for half a second, kind of like I'm Not a Monster, and just putting a hand on your shoulder to silently say "yep, I'm a Vampire, and now you're one too" (like maybe they hold a card between their fingers and have you look at it)

so they needed to do it somewhere where they could handle the aftermath

dear god, this idea is terrifying, it's like, don't groups have bad enough predation undertones as it is? this feels like some kind of sick fucked-up teambuilding exercise from hell, like something you'd see in the corporate cult from Lodge 49

in fact, fucking hell, I'm soft-moving this to Pitches and Scripts, it's more of a psychological horror premise than a game concept: at a corporate party, it turnns out people are getting laid off, but you get a bonus if you can convince the next person to get a lesser bonus, so you just do it by quietly presenting them with a figure in a corner, and you're qualified to make these offers once you've accepted termination yourself...

oh my god, see new title

oh wow, what if the first two-thirds of the movie, everybody's just like "oh god, what am I going to tell my family, how am I going to live on this", but in the last third, they go "you know what? fuck their noncompetes, that shit is unconstitutional, and we've just unplugged all the lawyers we'd need to fight it"

## how I just pitched it to Tiare

The idea, it'd be at the corporate party where a Maven-like company has just bought a Sports-Illustrated company, and they've just revealed that they're going to be, like, flipping a coin on every employee to see whether or not they're fired without severance at the end of the night. But one of the employees has been deputized to offer generous resignation packages, on the condition of discretion: they can't expose that they've offered resignation to anybody who won't take an offer.

And anybody who takes an offer is also authorized to give offers, under the same condition: if they're exposed by somebody not taking a buyout, they lose everything and are immediately fired. (Also, needless to say, mentioning you got an offer you didn't take from someone is also a firing offense.)

So, like, Ed from Accounting goes to the bathroom, and then he feels a gentle hand on his shoulder, and in it is just "$78,000" written on a note

or there's some kind of structure where you get to keep an amount if you can make X people resign for Y budget

so it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers, but with union busting. Almost like that episode of Bojack, but with an actual slasher-movie escalation of paranoia

Hmm, maybe go for the full Battle Royale apocalyptic hellworld and make it so, if you're "fired without severance", so as to keep unemployment numbers low, you are just straight-up executed on the spot

Bloodthirsty insane Sears CEO guy introducing this to the crowd: "Time for some game theory."

Oh man, you have it go by "we developed an AI to cull half our staff based on profitability by a thousand different metrics taken into account proportionally to our bottom line, which we are keeping proprietary, and it will take the bottom half of whoever's left after resignations", so everyone preying on the employees is "come on, do you REALLY think you're above average? of the people who DESERVE to work here?"
