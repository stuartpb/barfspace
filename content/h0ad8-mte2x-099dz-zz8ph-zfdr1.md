# why all this "Generalized Templating System" stuff overlaps

with other tools I'm interested in, other ideas I have, etc.

## the microservices angle

also overlaps with some ideas that've been percolating for me lately about a Module-Tree-style "server" with route behavior specified per-file.

the core thing with that is that it defines "here are the static files" as routes, right next to "here are the dynamic components needed to implement, like, operators"

## Why does this keep intersecting with Helm?

I guess it's because, at the end of the day, the whole idea here is to have a template system that builds a document tree that defines a functioning website
