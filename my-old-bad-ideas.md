It's funny: the consistent theme of all these bad ideas is that I was convinced that the thing inhibiting my creativity was the lack of a venue for it.

Though, actually, come to think of it... was I wrong? I mean, that's essentially what it took: look at how my output *exploded* once I found Cloud9.

So I guess it's actually kind of sad.

But yeah, another thing, as I put for an idea originally written down as "A Federated Wiki of StackOverflow-type questions answered with Octopress-type posts.":

> This seemed like a smart idea when I wrote it, but looking back, it's redundant to... Stack Overflow questions and Octopress posts. This idea failed one of the criteria I've only really come to understand in the last few years: "is there anything stopping the kind of user who'd know what to do with this from doing it themselves today?"

*(Update: in light of [what I'm doing right now with Lean Notes][leannotes#2] where I'm effectively turning it into a federated wiki of guides, that last one is especially hilarious)*
