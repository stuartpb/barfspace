# A Daredevil scene about Punishment

What is the role of punishment? Without an ongoing relationship with the offender, how can authorities change a person's behavior?

There's a scene I have in mind, where Matt would be coming to confession, having gotten a major windfall in his legal business, at the cost of some crooked thing (like he helped a rich criminal go free, something like that), where Matt worked out his inner demons by beating the client up as Daredevil or something like that.

MATT
Forgive me father, for I have sinned.

FATHER WHOEVER
(whatever the thing you're supposed to say back is, I forget)

MATT
I broke a man's face.

FATHER WHOEVER
Oh, of course you did.

MATT
I mean, I did a bunch of other stuff to him, too...

FATHER WHOEVER
Oh, yeah, I figured...

MATT
But, yeah, the face thing, pretty much the top of the pile, figured I'd go ahead and just...

FATHER WHOEVER
Yeah yeah, I think I get the picture, Matt.

MATT
I know you're very busy, Father, you know. Save a couple minutes.

FATHER WHOEVER
I'm thinking back a couple weeks ago, when you told me about how you broke that man's legs.

MATT
Man's *leg*. Well, and both knees. I guess knees are part of the leg... yeah, I guess you could say "legs".

FATHER WHOEVER
And it sounded like you were cutting for time a bit then, too.

MATT
Well, you had me do ten Hail Marys (fill in something big here if that isn't much), I was here half the day begging the Lord's forgiveness.

FATHER WHOEVER
And He does forgive you, Matt. Christ's forgiveness is infinite. And I forgive you, too, it's just...
(sighs) How's business?

MATT
Oh, uh... it's actually picking up. We just had a big check come in, fifty thousand dollars for helping this...

FATHER WHOEVER
Put all of it in the donation box.

MATT
(chokes)
Put the, huh, what?

FATHER WHOEVER
Your penance. Fifty thousand, in the donation box.

MATT
That's... it's not my money to spend! I can't just go back to Foggy and Elektra(?) and tell them I just made a generous donation of their paychecks to the Church.

FATHER WHOEVER
Then tell them you blew it all on a bad bar backroom bet. Got full of yourself, put it all on red one time too many.

MATT
That's just... you're... *greed*, doesn't even *start* to cover...

FATHER WHOEVER
This isn't greed, Matthew, it's punishment, and long overdue at that. Matt, God forgives your sins, but He does so in the hopes you'll find redemption, and it's my job as His servant to see to it that you find His path to it - and you have... *strayed*. *Far.*

I'm trying to make you see - really *see*, and I hope you'll forgive the choice of words there, but you need to not just *acknowledge* that what you've been doing is wrong, you need to *feel* that what you're doing is wrong, and I'm at the limits of what my Inquisition Rolodex can wring out of you. Maybe your friends feeling the consequences of your actions is what it's gonna take for *you* to start feeling them.

MATT
This is... this took *months* of... late nights, working weekends, trips across town, I spent an entire day waiting just outside a courtroom, just to get a hold of one - what are we going to put on our quarterly filings? This guy Fisk is already itching to bring a RICO case against us...

FATHER WHOEVER
Tell you what, Matt, maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm overreacting. How about, you go ahead, this man whose face you broke, tell me, what came before that? What was just the next most bad thing you did, you were thinking I didn't need to hear?

(We flash back to Daredevil kicking a man in the crotch, causing him to fall face-first on Matt's fist, then spinning onto the pavement where his skull cracks)

MATT
(beat)
I'll make it out to the Archdiocese?

FATHER WHOEVER
And next time, don't let it ride.
