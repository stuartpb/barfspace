# Professional Helmbags

These are [Helmbags](a6b94843-8569-4a45-a25d-ae69a2d9fc22.md) for charts that a whole person would "need to be able to do their job".

This is a broad category that overlaps with a few others, but it still has some unique entries

## Technical-user

- [System Administration Helmbags](1f46ee2a-7553-46fc-9279-b5cd3390b956.md)
- [Development Suite Helmbags](6aeb2266-593d-4a39-b578-30fe97873f92.md)

## Office suite

- mintable for accounting (instead of Quickbooks or whatever)
- some spreadsheet app
  - there was that one that I think was in Rust, backend-only? could be compiled for WASM and hooked into a frontend engine?
  - whatever goes here, add a thing to mintable to integrate it
- see [Plain Old File-Friendliness](8aea78fe-9cbe-4284-a57f-ed3756f477ed.md) for "Google Drive"

a lot of this other stuff

## Creativity suite

Getting real pie-in-the-sky here, I don't know if there are truly good offerings

- Video editor
- Vector image editor
- Raster image editor

## Logistics person

- [Logistics Helmbags](349b812c-49c9-4903-be4d-ccdbeefbfbe2.md)
  - might also interact with Metrics (currently classified under [System Administration](1f46ee2a-7553-46fc-9279-b5cd3390b956.md))
