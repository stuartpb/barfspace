# Virtual Tabs Deck

noting here that I'm kind of prototyping this via Hubs [for my wedding notes](9bwkd-dekxg-ye8t5-fejnq-rasw5)

## original notes

following out from the "How is this not a Vive wand" stuff from [this peripheral idea](zgfdh-55mqf-gb94q-jg6j8-se3v3), which started going into "it's just a simple surface, you barely need anything for AR"

this would be an AMAZING idea to have as, like, imagine all these cards you have around you (you could even have it tracking playing cards as identifiers!) are handles to "windows", and so you can keep bookmarks in a "deck"

so, one idea I'm thinking is that the card you're holding represents a "collection", and you can do gestures (or press virtual "buttons") on/with the card to separate out "windows" that'll only be open while the card is held

but of course those are optional and you can just keep to a one window per card model

anyway, when you want to switch contexts you put the card down - it is represented by the document that was on the card when it was held

You can have it know when you're putting a card into a "stack"

Note that when I say "window" here, I'm thinking in terms of a "window" in the [Windowsystem Metabrowser](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k) sense - they're tracked in a serialization model as simple as "this buffer / view of this file, at this position".

You can also put the card in a "holder" and it'll display like it's your "monitor", where you can manipulate a cursor with your computer's mouse and type with your computer's keyboard (and its associated "while holding" windows remain open, and can be gestured around, maybe using the card to attach/detach, to switch tabs).

you can also "virtualize" all that state off from a card and into a meta collection that can be transferred to (or shared with) another card, in which case it will take on a separate visual state, like maybe a titled frame around the "window attached to this card" that can be empty

Now that I think about it, the "card" can be an actual phone / tablet, can't it?  and the "flung off window" can be an app construct that uses ARCore to present a "switch tabs" view

## embracing this occluded-switching-context view

so, one of the ideas I had around the "window" idea would be that every time you "click a link" you "drop" the currently open page spatially, and then if the link you're navigating to is already open in the room, it moves to your phone (you can give the page a "home position" for the room)

if you stay navigating in the same position, it doesn't save, so you don't end up having to do

I'm thinking moving the phone past a certain threshold, unless your finger on the screen, is enough to trigger "breakaway" mode

oh man, this means you can pull out from a virtual page, then that's your interface for viewing and touching "copy link" buttons

there's also "touch the on-screen-distant page", and I guess another button next to "copy link" would be "set home position"

OK, so, I'm explicitly viewing this in terms of Bagtent now

I'm thinking each page can have a list of "Rooms this page is open in", like "what links here", and that can be one way to change to a different view

you're also allowed to just place a link to a different room as a totem

this can also let rooms be like virtual [Tabalanche](3ex5c-s1wt7-s290e-zx6q3-88jp0) stashes

Oh wow, you could do a thing where page lengths are represented by little scroll-style rollups when you pull out, also recording your scroll position

(two-dimensional page size, ie. zoom, is represented by the shorter side "fading out" beyind the extents of the screen)

I think "flip and fling" are maybe essential here, where you can have tabs/windows/cards "stacked"

anyway, the "window-per-document" thing was about how this is meant to be a way to create a 3D document structure, which is why it's designed to reuse tabs for already-open links by default

SIDE NOTE: that'd be a cool browser feature, "highlight links to open tabs differently" - on the greater Web, I know the ship has probably sailed on that style-wise, but you could do it with a different cursor hover state
