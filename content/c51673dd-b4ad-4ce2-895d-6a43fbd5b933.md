# on where to insert footlinks, when using them

(Like other [practices for footlinks](9ff2ea44-fd1c-4b11-a075-1956f9f8784a.md), the move to [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md) has mostly addressed the issues listed here.)

this has a few references lingering around in other notes before I had a certain place to put them, but footnotes should live close to their point of usage, because it makes trucking content across files easier. It also leaves fewer dead references that have no links in the body hiding in the gaps.

one of those aforementioned places listed elsewhere in the notes: [this old history node](f050ead6-eb3d-44f3-8612-1ca67c91f299.md) (from which it should be raided later)

Having footlinks far down on the page led to so many problems that I eventually jotted this note down in [an old note](2015dc83-db74-4f1f-a089-d07c3bd38dc1.md) (which it has been moved out from) in frustration:

> - [x] Note that all links should repeat their symbolic references in each section (try to use a consistent ref per page though), so the section can be moved to another page smoothly

I even thought that bagtent-rig would solve this issue (instead of inlining links, which actually did).
