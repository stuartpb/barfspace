# The Cartesian Forum

this is currently the closest thing to [the boxesin concept](171a2617-8920-4ed9-ac6d-6488d023580f.md) living in these notes, at least data-structure-wise - this has a lot of similarities to earlier conceptions of how Boxesin would be modeled, with less emphasis on being able to move and reparent the boxes

this is my take on forums that have "posts", based largely on the matter that I've had people tell me I'm "taking up too much space" by writing

see, like, I don't think people should take the amount of *activity* that a person engages in as an amount of *space*.

So basically, the main innovation in this experiment is, what if we had a forum where the amount of "space" that one is "taking up" is an actual two-dimensional metric, ie. one can reduce the screen-space of a post

Notifications are done by lassoing the region you want notifications for

that's kind of a dumb idea, but it does kind of make sense to have notifications be regional - basing it on the region of the screen that's within the viewport is probably fine (this firms up in further descriptions below)

okay, so, one key point to make is that, in this model, it's like an imageboard in that images are highly recommended, as your post will otherwise be represented as a colored square

Posts are initially made by drag and dropping a "New square" from the corner onto the current viewport. You can then resize the square as desired

Each rect expands to take the viewbox of the screen's "square" space when tapped (ie. the top or left), and the "post" is displayed on a sidebar, along with a truncated tree view into its child posts (with the "path" on the first line, the "title" (if any) on the second, and the opening of the "body" (if any) on the third)

A post can be edited by anybody who's authorized as an owner of the post, and anybody can be made an editor of a post. child posts on that post can be rescaled and rearranged by the owners of the post they're within the bounds of, but the dimensions can only be adjusted by the post's owner.

the list of a post's owners can have a spot for "suggest people right of this marker as owners of child posts" - you can move the marker left of your own avatar if you want to suggest editorial control of subposts, but it's always negotiable by the poster

the "summary" line of child posts can also be edited by the ownership of the parent space.

there should probably also be a "teams" facility that lets groups of users operate as a shared identity

Any user can drag a square to cover any number of posts: however, they can't *partially* overlap an existing post. A post will only be accepted by the server if it is accompanied with an explicit acknowledgement of every post it's covering up.

Historical posts can be viewed at any time by opening "history view", but if any user decides to overwrite any other user's post, there's no way to return the the previous post's context without the Ultimate Authority intervening (which involves a deep visibility recalculation)

posts are shifted in hue over the course of the year, and in saturation by number of years.

note creators can institute an "auto-shrink" rate to have child posts get smaller over time, better facilitating their replacement or moving to be archived (perhaps also a "drift" setting that lets posts drift off of the edge of the rect and get deleted)

This is pretty much my new version of boxesin

I feel like the right data structure for a post in this is:

- center relative to parent
- scale relative to parent (as fraction)
- wfh (width as a factor of height)
- owners (array)
- body, description, etc
