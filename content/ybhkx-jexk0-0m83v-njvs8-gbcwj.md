I was trying to figure out why I was feeling so calm through COVID, and now I realize: it's because I was so mad that nobody was being punished for anything they were doing, and now we're all being punished by the Virus.

I try not to think about the punishment is still not being meted out remotely fairly, how the least fortunate are experiencing it in silent masses
