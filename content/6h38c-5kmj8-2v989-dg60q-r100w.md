# On performing Understanding Lua as a video series / live

Since Understanding LUa is meant to be written in graphic form, I'm essentially writing a script, which made me wonder, in the original project, if I should be writing Understanding Lua in Markdown.

At the time, my reaction was "I guess the main reason I'm reluctant to embrace Fountain is that I'm not sure I could commingle fenced code blocks with descriptions the way I intend to going forward."

These days, a year later, having established a robust notes tree, my bigger feeling is that I just need to get *something* drafted up in Markdown here, and once that's settled, I can start thinking about writing Fountain scripts.

I did realized [in the Lean Notes issue that started some of the integrative work that ultimately led to this note consolidation](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/2#issuecomment-422289851) (TODO: link to the in-tree continuation of this issue's consideration, if one materializes) that this could *really* work, especially considering how many props (read: toys) I have, as a video series.

I was thinking of doing this in something like Google Blocks and/or Tilt Brush at one point (using reference models in TB to represent the different concepts), but I'm thinking about it now, and I could probably do a really cool thing with this with just a camera, some toys, and a checkered/gridded tablecloth (where the grid squares are big enough to hold a plate), while still being small enough that we can fit like eight rows maybe on the depth of the table.
