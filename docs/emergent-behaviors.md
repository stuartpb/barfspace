so one thing that's kind of emerged as a thing I do in this paradigm with the git history and everything is taking a file that was really messy, figuring out what I was really trying to get at, then editing the file so it's just that, then, after the commit with that comment is pushed, deleting the file, so that last iteration is its "tombstone"

this is the kind of thing I'd kind of do in commit messages, but, like, I usually don't commit files so messy that I only have little kernels of workable content in them? so it only really becomes a thing in this repo
