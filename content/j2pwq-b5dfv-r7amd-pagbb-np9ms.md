# Tidying Up

It's not *everything*, but I am making some progress by documenting [Project HOARD][HOARD]

## Offering Things Up

I should get rid of these extra vacuum cleaners I have.

Maybe I should check out OfferUp?

There are also Buy Nothing groups on Facebook, but I'd want [Fuck Facebook Fridays](7htms-dhhfk-1jaf0-pah8v-6ya0r) going before I do that.
