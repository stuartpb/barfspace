# Federating and Distributing Trees like These Notes

This is a subproject of the [Engineering Core](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) for the Federated World of [Smuggler's Code](b39ge-ag6e2-y39vc-qwm8a-cmwmy)

## A thought from revamping Messays

I was remarking on how I could want to do something like TVTropes' Laconic wiki, and then I realized that that can be a concept "forking" an existing bagtent wiki's symbols: to make alternate versions of the same content with a different "tone" or whatever - a differnt tree using the same symbols forms a different "namespace"

## Modeling Collaboration and Contribution

Pages considering what'd be needed to start federating:

- [The Shadow Curtain](wm7ba-3ycgc-wn8h2-pjnsv-xny45)
  - the (ambiguous) secret society branched from the [Notestack Engineers](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma)
  - Considering the tooling considerations of a single user spanning public and private content
- [A true Gossip Wiki (BISNES/BIGDOG)](qzdfm-gv3h5-r1a62-4edk3-8qw53)
