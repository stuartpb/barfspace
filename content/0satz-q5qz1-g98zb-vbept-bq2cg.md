# Trello Cards and Comments from "Basic I/O" List

## Let's talk output

> I've now explained enough to introduce the last component you need to write practical programs that interact with the outside world

## stdout appears behind me

> I used to believe stdout was important because you need it to see results in actual programming, but the thing is - these comics are *not* following normal code. We can visually see any value I hold in my hands- we don't need to go into how to expose these values to the outside world until later.

> I can make a comment in the early chapters, in which I sort of explain the structure of the book and the environment, how if the user wants to follow along, they can skip ahead to take a glimpse of the part where I get the `print` function, and then insert a `print(thing)` for any thing they want to see at a point in execution.

> Also, stdin input appears on it (in a different color?) so things are less confusing

## Let's also talk input

> You often don't need input when you can just change your code, but while we're here, we might as well.

## Stdin

> Standard in is a typewriter. It has parts that are controlled by the io library functions, like an arm that eats the paper you've typed and puts it into work-space.
