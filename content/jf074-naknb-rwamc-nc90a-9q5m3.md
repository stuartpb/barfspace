# Links from Hacker News

## July 2019

- [How the Dat Protocol Works](https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/) [(comments)](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20363813).
  - Great resource. Apparently the same author also did one on Secure Scuttlebutt.
- [Lenovo has simulators for the UI of all their BIOSes.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20361345) Links in that thread point to other similar "UI simulators".
- [The Wood Database](https://www.wood-database.com/). For all your identifying-wood needs.
- [An impromptu discussion of gauge blocks and wringing.](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20365981) Not sure why anyone on Hacker News would be liable to use this, but whatever.
- [The death watch for the X Window System has probably started](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20376041) - why it's good to pay attention to who's maintaining what projects, and what their incentives to switch are.
