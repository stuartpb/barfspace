## storage

https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/storage/ suggests Longhorn might make distributed storage simple enough

https://github.com/rancher/local-path-provisioner/blob/master/README.md probably explains how to back that; how can I use an SD card as the backing storage device?

## security

[rootlesskit](https://rancher.com/docs/k3s/latest/en/advanced/#running-k3s-with-rootlesskit-experimental) could be cool

## apps to self host

Mastodon

## network layer

- [Calico](https://docs.projectcalico.org/introduction/) and ["Canal"](https://docs.projectcalico.org/getting-started/kubernetes/installation/flannel) (per https://rancher.com/learning-paths/introduction-to-kubernetes-namespaces/)
