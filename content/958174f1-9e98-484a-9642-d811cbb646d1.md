# Printing Transparent Keys

changing the swap-materials line to `sed -i 's/^T0/T2/;t;s/^T1/T0/' $1`

Rounding out the inside of the D-pad a little more

This is my first test print on the rewinding spool

## result

The little light in the case isn't really enough to illuminate the keys, even with nothing in the way.

further experimentation with this will need dedicated lights in the case
