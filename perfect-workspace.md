# My Perfect Workspace World

The thing that I want - all I want out of the world (as far as having room to experiment with software goes) - I mean, really, my perfect human experience looks like:

- Universal basic income (of the "income plus" variety where other basic needs like healthcare are also provided by the state)
- Free virtual machines for anybody whose work is robustly open source (ie. following [SACRED][] principles).

I like the idea of the CNCF cluster, but it's too heavily gatekept right now

Like, the core of this is that, like, the "free VMs" thing... it should apply to *everyone*, whether they're an active contributor or just an "idle consumer" who basically only pulls other people's changes. So long as they're not using the VM for *proprietary commercial development*, it should be free.
