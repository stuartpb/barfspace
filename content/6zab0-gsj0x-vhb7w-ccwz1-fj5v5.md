# The Cardboard Fortress

This was an idea I originally had from a dream about some combination of school, a space station, and a water park, where the area under my loft bed became a sort of neutral territory.

I started considering how to work the idea into [the pirate story thing](mreq2-32p1d-g3a59-mb304-0xm20), influenced by other thoughts I've been having re: CHOP/CHAZ etc.

## the idea

Some guy is threatening the guy who does the piracy for the village, and so he stands in a cardboard box and declares it the border of the pirate state or whatever, and if you want to usurp his authority you just need to charge the box. the first guy to try it gets tackled to the ground by six different strangers
