# Booting from USB?

doing a `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

`sudo apt-get install exfat-fuse exfat-utils` to be able to open the Ventoy root

I did some stuff to get my Raspberry Pi bootable from USB to [reinstall sturl](8xb4h-y0jcz-6rb6n-2j62e-kjbk3). it didn't work

didn't feel like writing the log over the rest of this - I think I just ran the command to reconfigure boot order (but not actually changing it) to force a firmware flash of the new default value or something like that
