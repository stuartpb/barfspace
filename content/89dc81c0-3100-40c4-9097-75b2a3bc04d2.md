Got sick of wondering why stuff like wifi and dhcpcd were failing, so I decided to just do a full system overhaul with `sudo pacman -Sy && pacman -Qnq | sudo pacman -S -`

Hit this error once everything downloaded:

```

error: failed to commit transaction (conflicting files)
js52: /usr/lib/libmozjs-52.so.0 exists in filesystem
Errors occurred, no packages were upgraded.
```

ran `sudo rm /usr/lib/libmozjs-52.so.0` and retried

looks like everything went through basically fine - this was the worst error message

```
warning: directory permissions differ on /var/lib/samba/private/
filesystem: 755  package: 700
```

I can fix that in a bit, but for now I think it's worth powering down, unplugging the USB ethernet, and coming back up to see if the broken stuff works again.

(UPDATE: it didn't, hence why I [retired the installation](b0b9fa66-2760-42c9-8d52-59fa8d2957d0.md))
