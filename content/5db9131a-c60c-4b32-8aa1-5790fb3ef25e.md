# the ooze

(originally leaked out from [these thoughts on the top-links sprouting model](31396cb8-8b5e-4433-9174-c06b0bb0a9ed.md) for [bagtent](ba00b8cb-9d05-4aef-bd50-0990f82dd723.md))

these notes are like the raw version of what my programs look like, like this is the primordial ooze, the egg whites of what I do: it's just a bunch of random thoughts that dictate the program's behavior, but there's no attempt to structure them - they define a consistent whole, but it's like getting snapshots of different parts of an elephant. Programming is the act of putting all those parts together.
