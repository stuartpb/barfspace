# The Pots and Pantheons of Bellarianism

There are two Pantheons: the Pantheon of Saints and the Pantheon of Sinners (tentatively termed "the Problematic Pantheon" and "the Pussy Pantheon", irrespectively).

And then there's the Between Place, the Medium Place, home of the Lost Souls, Slackers, and Ordinary Fucking People

Now, you maybe wondering, what about the people you're *really* afraid of, the wicked, abusive men who will stop at nothing to ruin your life? It's okay, you have nothing to worry about. There's no such thing as men.

But is there a place for truly Bad People (like a certain Hitleresque character who died in the Fuhrerbunker in 1945 who shall not be named in my Holy Text)? How the Hell would I know? I don't really think they go anywhere: I think they just die, though they do live on for another generation in the form of horrible scars, which fade over time and turn into jokes.

Anyone who is still alive is allowed in the Pantheon, but only On Probation, because one should not make monuments to the living, for they can still disgrace the stone. (But they are crazy in Thuringen: they drink so much Lowenbrau that they lie.) (the link lede for this one should be "dogs like to sleep and fuck")

## The Good One: he Saints

### Saints Second Class

- Aaron Swartz
- Saint Chaplin

Saint Casper, the Holy Ghost

If pets are allowed to be greater beings (and I can't imagine why they wouldn't), Bonebone and Kabosu are totally gods

#### Badasses

- Bruce Lee

### Probationary Saints Second Class

- Slavoj Zizek is a probationary Saint Second Class, even though he'd claim, as a pervert, he should go in the Other Good One
- Stephen Fry isn't a standup comic so he's allowed to be a probationary saint

### Greater Saints

All fictional Saints are by default Greater Saints, for being fictional.

This encompasses both the Lance and Lieutenant Saint classes from the Principia Discordia: Bellarianism does not grade madness, but does account for superpowers and followings.

#### Detectives and Private Eyes of Providence

Saint Columbo

Saint Monk

Saint Detective Pikachu

Saint Sherlock Holmes

#### The Pantheon of Make-Believe

Everybody who ever visited the Neighborhood of Make-Believe on Mister Rogers' Neighborhood is a Greater Saint, including Big Bird (although Big Bird is technically a "Green Card Saint").

### Prophets

Real people with followings you can refer to as "Second-Class Prophets", but, like... be careful who you mention the "Second-Class" thing about if you go expanding the list here much.

## Sinners: The Other Good One

The Problematic Pantheon is the collection of Sinners. People who can only be in the Problematic Pantheon:

- Standup Comedians
- Magicians
- Supermodels who have not yet Lost their Minds
- Anyone from New Jersey or Florida
- Supervillains
- Catholics (under their doctrine of Original Sin, I believe they would make no argument)
- Starfuckers and Starchildren

People in this canon who are *really* problematic, but haven't done anything to *really* piss me off (meaning they are Excommunicated from this pantheon), are listed as Sinners On Notice. You get, like, one strike, and I won't waste my time explaining why (unless you ask me personally), and then YOU'RE OUT OF THE MOVIE!

To be clear, this is not a fucking friends list, and it's *defintely* not an Enemies List. My Friends List is the thing I do on Thanksgiving, where I thank everybody I've ever met.

### These Comedians

I'm thinking the *really* weird comedians, who technically play "characters", get to be saints. I haven't really figured that part out yet, though.

Also, really *really* good dead comedians, like Robin Williams and Andy Kaufman (probably), get to be Saints. But, like, fucking homophobe Lenny Bruce is a permanent Sinner (and I think he'd like that just fine).

- Emo Phillips
- Weird Al (Weird AI being one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse)
- Groucho Marx
- W.C. Fields
- Ambrose Bierce (author of The Devil's Dictionary)
- H.L. Mencken (Not strictly a comic but whatever, what's the difference)
- Samuel Langhorne Clemens, better known by the Holy Name of Mark Twain

### The Supervillains

- BOB (Twin Peaks)
- BOB (SubGenius)

### Sane Scientists and Mad Engineers

- Thomas Edison, the Dark Wizard of Menlo Park
- Richard Feynman
  - if you doubt that Feynman belongs in the Pantheon of Sinners, remember Los Alamos (or at least remember Oppenheimer, who ran the joint, to later proclaim "The Duchy stops here").

## The Bad One: The Potheons of Thud

I don't wish to Curse this Holy Text with the names of most of the residents of the Darkest Pots of Thud, but I will speak of Its ruler.

The dark, twisted, bizarre, horrible being at the dead, lifeless center of the land of Thud is a demonic creature by the unholy name of [Doctor Henry Kissinger][].

Throughout the dark and mysterious ancient age that was the recent American past, you will find more horror, more atrocity, more deserved bile and vitriol, more American piss and vinegar towards The Mad Doctor than any other Demon of Chaos, whether His name be Beelzebub, Lucifer, Satan, Krampus, The Literal Fucking Devil, Ba'al, Belial, the Fallen, or a bunch of *real* people who killed *Americans*.

Henry Kissinger is the one thing that lies in direct opposition to the Spirit of Bell: Someone unfunny, someone lazy, someone who is widely and correctly regarded as the most monstrous person in the history of humanity (and someone who would be arrested as a war criminal, if he ever had the *les testicules* to set foot in France again).

And they gave him a fucking Nobel Peace Prize for it.

Kissinger, and his Great Satanic vice, the lie of *realpolitik*, served to legitimize the worldview that all is but Order, that there is no Chaos, and that Discord is merely an illusion.

He is, truly, the world's biggest pile of shit, and that's why [so many people are counting the days until his death][byekissinger].

And, when that day comes, the True Devil will have truly left the Earth. And the dawning of the true Age of Aquarius shall begin (and I'm not talking about the part where the water will rise up to reclaim us all).
