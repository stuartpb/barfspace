# Following the Official Tutorials

Not to be confused with [any earlier tutorial following](zrckg-chfzb-8ma8p-7c5hs-wqtek)

## [Hello Minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/hello-minikube/)

skipping this; I already set up minikube, I don't intend to use it (I've got Stubernetes for the kind of practical experimentation I want), and the next tutorials don't even use it

## [Learn Kubernetes Basics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/)

- Create a Cluster (Using Minikube)
  - Isn't this just Hello Minikube again? Skipping this too
- Deploy an App: Using kubectl to Create a Deployment
  - So `kubectl create deployment` is like a persistent version of `kubectl run` - they both just take a Docker image name to make pods for (as a Deployment vs a one-off)?
  - It feels like a Deployment is kind of analogous to a `.service` file in systemd
  - In light of this, one of the things I've been noodling on is that I need a better understanding of Services in k8s, which are different from Deployments
- Explore Your App: Viewing Pods and Nodes
  - Skipping this, I already understand this
- Using a Service to Expose Your App
  - [this](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/expose/expose-intro/#services-and-labels) is a nice graphic
  - oh, the note about `kubectl create deployment --expose` is interesting
  - the interactive part just has us create a NodePort service... boring
  - ohhh, I think I'm starting to get Services: [further notes here](732k4-283fb-deajz-t9m6c-80d0t)
- Scale Your App
  - Reading: okay, so, like, what's the deal with ReplicaSets? When is that gonna come into play?
  - Starting the interactive bit: oh, here
  - Wait, so Deployments create *ReplicaSets* that create Pods?
  - Okay, running `kubectl describe rs` to grok this: more [here](ns1ca-rd2b6-wvaw9-vadpz-hxcg9)
- Update Your App
  - Aw yiss, this is what I'm talking about
  - Okay, so rollout policies just kind of happen magically? It's not explaining where this versioning / transition data lives
