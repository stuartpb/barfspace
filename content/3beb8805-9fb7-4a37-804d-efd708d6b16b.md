# Playlist of songs that have tragically not been made yet

- mashup of I Want Candy with Walk Like An Egyptian
- Aria from *Gummi Bears: The Opera*
- Close To You, but without the creepy slurping noises
- Smooth jazz cover of Solsbury Hill

- Luigi's Mansion theme, with Tom Nook Mart instrumentation (Luigi's Mart-sion)
- the Metroid theme using the sound palette of Tame Impala's "Elephant"
- a slow dark moody synth Pet Shop Boys cover of "You've Got to Get a Gimmick"?
- The "Mama's Talkin' Loud, Mama's Doing Fine" part of Rose's Turn, but on the piano in minor chords or whatever that make it sound like the Moonlight Sonata or otherwise creepy (like it could be Castlevania background music)
- View to a Kill / Sittin' on the Dock of the Bay mashup
- The Star Spangled Banner, but [the Inception sound](https://inception.davepedu.com/) instead of "BRAVE" at the end
- I Got a Man mashed up with [the Zoom email song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=osUNhSBKL6E&list=PLfKpFSV221BfJr8jfWKfHvrSHcQ2jVTwR)
- [The Westworld version of Wicked Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zFvGxiYwoc), but instead it's Cold War by Styx
