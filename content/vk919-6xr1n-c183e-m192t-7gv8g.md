# Bellarianism's "Greater Suckers": The Worst People in the World

This is basically the Bellarian version of the lowest circles of Hell - it's not [Second-Class Sinners][], where the cool-albeit-problematic examples go. It's for the lowest of the low, the people who reacted to a cruel and unfair world not by trying to fix it, not by trying to expose it, but by ignoring everything around them and being complete assholes.

Not including [The Worst of the Worst][Henry Kissinger].

## Adolf Eichmann

We're not gonna talk about that *other* Adolf. He's... too obvious, too caricatured. There are other places we can talk about him, far, far away in the Notes, not touching the Fresh Book.

No, we're talking about *Eichmann*. The small-minded Nazi who represented everything that makes one *go* Nazi.

See [Eichmann in Jerusalem][] for a fuller explanation. Eichmann is the Sucker for who the term "The Banality of Evil" was coined.
