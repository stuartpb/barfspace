# Wayside as an org

Just created a Docker Hub org for Wayside

## first repo

I want to make a repot to contain Helm charts...

Almost went with "deployment.wayside.xyz" per https://github.com/coredns/deployment

but I'm thinking now I'll go with a model like that repo, but the top-level will be "packaging.wayside.xyz", since the idea is this'll handle all of wayside's bespoke "packaging"
