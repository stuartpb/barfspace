# Power Supply Jones

Just thinking about how this new fancy power supply I got can maybe power a Raspberry Pi? I already forgot its amperage

I think there was this QuickCharger I was going to build a circuit like that for? Notes for this might be somewhere in my old Tabalanche tabs?

Maybe I just wanted to remember I can put the 3.3v voltage regulator on its 5v output to power an ESP-01, as well as using it at 5v with a MicroUSB connection into a board with an onboard voltage regulator
