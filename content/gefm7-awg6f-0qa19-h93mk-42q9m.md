# App Ideas for Project Parking

- the ParkedProject.con Service
- [thoughts specifically around the DNS-oriented aspect of Parked Project](85j93-vjbaa-479dw-26bwv-1mdra)
- I'm also thinking of this in terms of [Ops in a Box](0dehw-8kxsa-81amj-gp4kk-td8cw), where you want this to pre-configure as being instance-wide for one project, and the user is definitely registered from an outside authority
