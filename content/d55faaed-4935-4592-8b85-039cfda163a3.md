# late may 2019 notes metajournal

I just merged the Barfspace Quests into the old Department of Improvement Office Bureau of Construction Planning District or whatever, which is now simply termed "Department of Barfspace".

I also just ripped the links to Vision and Implementation out of Operations, because they're really pretty different, and their differences can be summed up by the stuff listed on the Barfspace node.

A reflection: is there a logic to the "Part of X" headings? It seems like they're there to reflect a page's "true parent", for when several other pages link to it.

Now that I think about it, pages should maybe be ordered by backlinks first. I'll make a note in the note about breadcrumb navigation about that.
