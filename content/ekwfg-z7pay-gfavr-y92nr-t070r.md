# Lean Notes from Trello to slides

One of the lists on [Lean Notes' old Introspection and Plans meta board](55ph0-a1t6w-4wa52-x3dwc-qd5qr) was about converting the boards to presentations. I've copied the content from that list here, where it might become relevant at some point in the future (I've already encountered one thing that brought me to paste it into these notes)

Each board is a different slideshow / presentation

Using reveal.js / slid.es Or maybe impress.js?

See if we can maybe do a cut-down version of reveal.js

2019 note: [here](https://github.com/hiroppy/fusuma) is a project that does this (Fusuma)

Presentations start on the Overview

Each card is a slide or whatever

Internal links are entirely different-looking slides, with the background of the linked presentation and the title in Big letters
