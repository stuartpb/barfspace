# Selling to Help

My general theory and philosophy of sales, in all walks of life.

## Pitch

A bwhatever (book? booklet? blog? blurb?) on my philosophy of helping people to know what you can do for them, and what they can do for themselves. Includes all the wrestling and grappling I do with in balancing and reconciling the needs of our individual circumstances, our need to survive in the broader capitalist dystopia we're all stuck in, and the greater human condition that fundamentally connects us all.

## Progress

I originally had the idea for this at 4:40 AM at the hotel for a trade show, where I couldn't sleep, and wanted to make a note that I would write down the things that were running through my head.

Just making that note was enough to get me to sleep, and I never ended up returning to this concept on its own: however, within Lean Notes, this proposition ties into a number of areas briefly touched upon in the original Trello series (such as [Monetizing and Accounting][], [Launching and Releasing][], [Spread Strategy][], and [Acting in the Ecosystem][]), so I expect that this umbrella will probably work its way into the corpus fairly smoothly going forward.
