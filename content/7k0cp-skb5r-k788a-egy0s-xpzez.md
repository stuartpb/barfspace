# Cover letters for Disney jobs

## Sr Software Engineer (OneID)

re https://jobs.disneycareers.com/job/seattle/sr-software-engineer/391/11284014

I am proficient in many programming languages beyond JavaScript, such as Lua, C, and Bash. I've designed and developed many solutions spanning several technologies, determining which is appropriate for each situation and treading lightly in complex environments.

## Sr Software Engineer (Parks)

I'm rigorously adherent to industry best-practice processes: I built Plushu especially so I could run my own 12-factor applications without having to compromise their architecture. I've participated in the design process of new features and enhancements to the Web platform itself.

Been using Node.js since 2012, and over the last few years have focused largely on single-page apps, mostly using Node to implemented REST services, of which I have designed several, from IoT device APIs to a realtime messaging signalling platform.

I've done coding, technical design, and end-to-end testing for my projects

I'm known for clearly documenting my own work products and review and contributing to the documentation across multiple projects: I've been the impetus for more than one team I've joined to start actively using an internal wiki.

I'm current with trends in the technology marketplace: I'm always learning about what's on the horizon, with systems like Kubernetes, which I've been familiarizing myself with for container orchestration.

## Parks background

(also writing to [parks boneyard](a7wpm-ndftr-gp866-9zwts-9nmxc))

Of all the places I could apply, I really, really want to work for Disney. I've taken regular trips to Walt Disney World since as far back as I can remember, back when Innoventions and Test Track were still Communicore and World of Motion. Going back to Walt's original vision of an Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow, I think the Disney Parks are marvels of modern engineering. I've played Sorcerors of the Magic Kingdom, I've read the NFC tag on my MagicBand, and I've worked with the Fastpass+ system. I would love to contribute to this ecosystem.
