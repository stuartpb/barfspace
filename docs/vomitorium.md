wow, I can't think of a bigger "fuck you" than classifying all the stupid meta files as "docs"

maybe it's the pressure from renaming like that but I'm going to go ahead and just start deleting the docs in here that are irrelevant and don't really have anything interesting to say

part of me feels like this is a betrayal of the original intentions behind making this barfspace repo, but, nah, because the point was to make something where I'm not fussing over "oh, is this good enough to ship", and I'd say I've achieved that

like for instance, with that last line I actually did get a second of "oh, wait, should I keep going, do I have more to say", and then I took somewhere around ten seconds to think about it, and then autocommit was just like "NAH BRO, 'S GOOD ENOUGH" and, you know what, that was pretty much the right call

And, you know, I think the thing where it'll just commit whatever happened the last time I paused if I start writing something and I go for more than ten seconds... I think I'm okay with that. Like, okay, fine, save whatever damn intermediate steps.

Man, it really is incredible how, like, I only notice the autocommit is about to happen *right when* I'd chicken out normally

You know one funny thing is that I find myself missing commit messages

like that thing I just did where I amended the file, waited ten seconds, then deleted it
