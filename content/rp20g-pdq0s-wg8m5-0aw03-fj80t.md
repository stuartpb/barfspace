# The Latest Trends and Lingo

This is a blob of thought that happened when I was navel-gazing right around the time these Quests were first getting written.

It's not really actionable, but parts of it might be rearrangeable into coherent content points.

For now, this node is the blob for referring to this tangled-up ball of thoughts: as they get detangled, those strings can be followed out from here. (Bagtent in action.)

[This Notestack Quest](gt833-j4kxw-838mc-41gzw-9w90a) touches some of the stuff described here about needing tooling for "TODO" (though, really, it's mostly not about tool support).

## extremely hot nonsense below

I think if I search that phrase, I'm going to find another place somewhere in these notes where I wrote that. The Welcome Wagon page, the one that's supposed to have the tour?

- [ ] Describe Editor (aka Gnome) Notes.
  - [ ] Why write them instead of actually doing the thing?
    - [x] Editor notes are like a chalk mark when you're doing an inspection in a room before the movers come in: it's for sketching out tasks on the page before doing anything big with it.
    - [x] Editor notes have to live on the page they're about.
  - [ ] What's their lineage? What's a Gnome?
    - [ ] Actually, what lineage does Barfspace owe to Wikipedia, anyway?
      - [ ] How does it take Wiki concepts to the extreme? How does it shatter them?
- [ ] Describe Blip Notes.
  - They're not-really-related inline one-offs that are written where they stand rather than figure out the appropriate place for them right now.
  - They're appropriate when the surrounding context helps illustrate what'd be involved in finding and/or building a proper home for them.
  - Sometimes, they should just be moved to Loose Notes, but don't stress it, man, it's Barfspace.
    - Weird tangent, that's what I thought "Forget it Jake, it's Chinatown" meant, even though I've seen that movie and [that is not what it's about][Chinatown].
      - Oh god though, when I had that "hey, what was the context for that line in Chinatown" thought and found this on Google,
      - I don't know if I've written about this in my Angst Zone yet, but this comes from me having seen Chinatown back in my "not really understanding movies" phase / days? I don't know, honestly, sometimes I watch an old movie, especially from the 70s, and I'm like, "okay, this is weird and hard to understand".
      - I should still rewatch all the movies I saw before about 2011. I still want to find out if Slacker is actually bad or if I was just incredibly fragile.
      - I should *really really* write a delta (see [Squashing the Deltas][], which I should maybe check and see if I need to explain more?)
      - I'm having this real brainwave here about how describing this TK: sidebyside SE vs me just casual
      - Oh man, "explaining what it feels like in my brain" hash tag here: what reading these notes feels like to other people is what reading what a lot of other people think is "intelligible" feels like to me
        - Actually, *should* I use hashtags? No, that's what the point of the pages is, to make it so you can use a link to a page explaining the tag as the hashtag, and you don't need to fuss about giving the idea a name, like right here I'm just calling it "this is what it's like to live in my brain" or, see, that's not even the same sentence, but without needing names it's a lot easier to describe
  - I think BLIP might actually work out really well, since there are lots of things where, like, this was the whole idea behind that "News" or whatever page that I'm not even linking to right now because I haven't used it, that sometimes I need to say what I *was* thinking of to explain why I'm thinking of this *other* thing, and without that context, like, I wouldn't care about it?
  - [ ] What's their lineage?
    - [x] Quick margin notes in notebook pages
- [ ] Describe TK notes.
  - There's a predating-the-caps-and-colon-convention editor note somewhere around here about incomplete sentences, and needing to have a way to say "I need to bounce, but here's a refresher of the rest of this sentence"
  - TK notes are that
  - You always want to write out as much as you can without /**/, because, as the old saying about code comments goes, "write your code comments clearly enough for another programmer to follow, because some day that programmer might be you".
  - So, like, you can potentially leapfrog massive amounts of [PPSS][] bottlenecking by writing an entire page in TK bottlenecking
  - I like the idea that, like, tk is always shorthand for improvements I can think but haven't typed
  - tk that one episode of seinfeld where jerry remembers a joke in the middle ofthe night
  - "tk" is basically a TODO comment that's potentially on every line
  - it tk expiring asset
  - so "tk" is, like, an explicit "I am being cryptic for brevity here", and it's not to confuse anybody
  - tk idle improvement
  - I feel like Henrietta Pussycat going "meow meow idle improvement", like I'm just hitting the important words
  - I think TK is going to catch fucking fire within barfspace, did I mention the vision of, like, once a line no longer has a tk on it that means it's Done&trade;, and like every line would have some TK
  - so I'd be trading off the speed of writing for the reliability of reinterpretation... shit, I've discovered a lossy realtime data compression convention for English
  - wait a second duh, this is just "shorthand", that's basically the real lineage of what tk's about, it's me throwing in a certain level of shorthand
  - and like, potentially the thing I write when I stop trying to make the fit but I give in and type "tk" can just make enough sense to not be rewritten, so a weird short tk just lives there like that
    - and everybody gets, "oh, hey, I'm not supposed to parse this like English, but yeah I get it"
  - BLIP: I need to tell Gravis about barfspace and especially this page and tk, I suspect they may dig it
  - The lineage of tk is I think on Wikipedia
  - Maybe I should use something with a bit more visual pop than "tk", something that has more visual distinction, like // ?
    - I feel like I tried this once and my connents started needing comments and I had to scrap the whole idea, but you know what, that's no reason not to try again with these symbols, even if I'm remembering this whole thing right
    - Oh, you know what? Maybe it's just that I need inline comments, too.
    - On that note, yeah I think C-style comments make the most symbolic sense for this repo
      - Though actually, I kind of like, what if it's percent signs? That makes it feel like Postscript, which is what these messes read like, like the pipe crashed and now there's Postscript commands in your markdown data
