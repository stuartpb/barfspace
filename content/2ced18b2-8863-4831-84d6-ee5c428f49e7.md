## integrate this: Normalization and Canonicalization

I was thinking about Gmail Canonicalization (where homoglyphs are, to some degree, treated as the same address)?

a little googling noted these pages:

- https://github.com/dblock/canonical-emails
- https://artsy.github.io/blog/2013/06/23/normalizing-gmail-email-addresses-with-canonical-emails/
- https://jameshfisher.com/2018/04/07/the-dots-do-matter-how-to-scam-a-gmail-user/ and [Hacker News comments about it](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16781959)

it's very important to note that canonicalization rules are per-domain
