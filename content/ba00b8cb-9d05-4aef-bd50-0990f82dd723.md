# bagtent

This is an index page for pages that talk about bagtent, ie. the tooling and structure of these notes

Most of these are carried out by the [Notestack Engineering Core](30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md), who also handle non-bagtent related projects for my notes (like the Git commit shotclock).

## historical remark

this ought to be incorporated into whatever history of bagtent/barfspace+LN/notes.stuartpb.com is drafted: https://github.com/stuartpb/how-i-roll/issues/3 was where I originally came up with the architecture

also, I think there might be an artifact about [Lean Notes][]' original README? I might have gone ahead and broken that down though. The one that described the repo's layout? I think all the content from the old Lean Notes readme has been dispersed one way or another

## Related

[The Academy](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md) collects documents about the structuring of these notes, which is heavily informed by bagtent.

[Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) collects reflections on organic tendencies that play around the design of bagtent

[The Organic Junction](379558c6-0383-4726-9cdb-9e5a89784dfa.md) lies somewhere between those two and this page - probably more between this one and the Academy (hence why this page will probably become the University of Bagtent and this page can maybe get a catchier name - maybe "The Institute of Notanicus", that sounds suitably insane for these notes)

## Related Tools

Lots of the Notestack Engineering stuff is relevant to bagtent, but [git-shotclock and its interface for loose integration with bagtent-orphans](df25aada-7f8c-420c-97bc-51366556b6be.md) is close enough that I feel it's appropriate to link here.

## Notes

These first-level lists should probably all become pages, and this just becomes a high-level index page that links to all the above pages, and all the below first-level-heading-cum-pages

- [the original bagtent braindump](9432d8de-485e-4253-8dcb-e8ed3dda45f9.md) which I've tried to split out (only one original digression still lives there now) into a series of sub-notes per overall cohesive "thought" (which have been moved into lists below).
- Bagtent Tool Notes (that should probably become a page):
  - [design for bagtent-sprout and bagtent-top-links](31396cb8-8b5e-4433-9174-c06b0bb0a9ed.md)
    - the [did you mean](b1bdad52-b669-4bf1-8708-6ef9d6dce47c.md) design doc that's barely even bagtent-related
  - [thoughts on making bagtent-destructure more useful](f5552a8b-b263-40ac-a719-a66fcb63094b.md)
  - [bagtent orphan integration script sketches](c9ae91e5-d3a3-405f-875c-eae734d9ec0e.md)
- other braindump stuff (pardon the awkward break, these are kind of separate trees)
  - These might move back into the original braindump node, which then has a focus on "spec stuff"?
  - [thoughts on a style guide and best practices](70fa4c0d-914b-4e59-9a26-e1b3c99573e6.md)
    - [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md), if there isn't already a page about it (History Force? Understanding Lua's meta notes?)
    - This should maybe be looped in with The Organic Junction so they can inform each other
  - [extending and enhancing the basic bagtent model](539e354a-b20e-4ea3-9bdc-14cddac5cd76.md)
  - [notes on mixing content types](b2dade14-8a6c-4643-9fdb-2fc6b441016c.md) (kind of interplays with "extending")
  - [thoughts on "aliases" for short, fixed page names](6dfcd6df-31e9-46bb-9b75-d750a5456de8.md)
- Web navigation interface thoughts:
  - [thoughts on a renderer](4eba78a6-3d95-4a71-aa05-a3088af7e870.md)
  - I believe there's some stuff on breadcrumb navigation around the previous entry to be pulled out
  - [Horus, the Tree Navigation UI for Bagtent](87790b88-2585-4460-921e-a0dec3846b04.md)
  - [Borkflowy, the Bagtent Accordion concept](a8e3a3e4-a5d3-4407-8cd7-fd1d7df02bd7.md)
- Federation topics (this stuff should maybe get split off to be closer to the Scope Oracle / Visions):
  - [Bagtent Intelligence Gathering stuff][BISNES/BIGDOG]
  - [A Democratic Model for Federating Content](f8b2045d-b8e0-4e27-a565-43abb45b8e87.md)
  - [Federating Barfspace](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md) (mostly predates bagtent)
