# Great Pairings Throughout History

## General Guidelines

The two should be damn near inseparable counterparts, like, if you're talking about the former, you can't not talk about the latter.

It's okay if one's more prominent than the other, though: like, they never got around to making Rocky VII (Adrian's Revenge).

The two have to be lovers, even if the way they share their love isn't explicit (like Artoo and Threepio, who are *definitely* an old queer couple). They can't just be things or abstract concepts.

There shouldn't be other arguable pairings. Like, Ross and Rachel... I don't think so, man. And as much as I really, really, really want to, I can't include most of Joss Whedon's characters on this list (at least, not the Buffy ones), even when there's a very clear pairing like Buffy and Angel. (I also can't include that one because of the whole incredibly-abusive-Angelus-angle, but, you know.)

The dynamic of the relationship has to be mutual, healthy, and realistic. That's why we're not including any of the relationships from Twilight. (Sorry, folks, having the hots for a baby is not OK.)

Nothing against vampires, though. We *do* include Dracula's love for Lisa Tepes, because while he doesn't have a healthy relationship with the *world*, he did have a healthy relationship with *her* (and the tragedy was that she was *fixing* his love for the world).

Like, I need to make this clear: two characters that are *dating* do not count as lovers in my book. Count Olaf and Esme Squalor, for instance, don't really care about each other.

### Open question

Should Groundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow be counted on this list? I don't think they should. Neither should Jon and Laurie in Watchmen. The power dynamic of one person having infinite time and space enveloping the other is not a foundation for healthy love. *That being said*, I *do* think it is possible for Phil and Cage to *start* a healthy relationship with Rita (they're *both* called Rita, *goddess damn* Edge of Tomorrow was bold) with the wisdom they have gained after exiting the loop: however, as the development that relationship is not textually explored in the films, I don't believe they should be counted here. (Now, if my sequel to Edge of Tomorrow ever gets made, where Cage and Rita get married and have kids, and then their *children's* deaths send them back in time...)

(And yeah, the moment they experience the loss of a child, they jump back to the moment of their kids' conception, every time it happens, and it happens a *lot*. It's hilarously horrifying. Hollywood: call me.)

## Rejected pairings

### Unrequited Loves

- Venus and Adonis
- Cable and Deadpool (if Deadpool can be said to truly love Cable)

### Erotic Nemeses

- Dumbledore and Grindelwald
- Adora and Catra
- Holmes and Moriarty
- Patience and the Amazing Screw-On Head
- Will and Hannibal
- Batman and Joker

### Murder/Suicide Buddies

- Sid and Nancy
- Kurt and Courtney
- Romeo and Juliet
- Ladd and Lua (even though I *so* want to include this one)

### Mentor/Child Dynamics

- Ralph and Vanellope (yes, this is despite us having *dressed as them*)
- Batman and Robin
- Simon and Marcy
- Rocky and Frank N. Furter
- Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle
- V and Evey
- Peter Pan and Wendy (though *which one is which* is up to you)
  - Peter's relationship to Tinkerbell is similarly ambiguous, if you consider Hook as canon

### Probably Just Friends

- Holmes and Watson
  - The show Sherlock got the Holmes/Watson dynamic perfectly: Watson's too romantic for Sherlock.
  - Like I said, no couples where there are arguable better pairings. Watson was widowed, man.
- Annie and Owen
  - I do have a different romance from Maniac on the list, though

## Included

- Laura and Urkel
- Rocky and Adrian
- JFK and Jackie
- C3PO and R2D2
- Kumar and Bag of Weed
- Sam and Diane
- Morticia and Gomez
- Van and Earn
  - I believe in this one, because Van hasn't really had anybody else come along who's a match for her as *deeply* as Earn. There was that one German guy, but *charming* does not strictly equal romantic.
  - As Atlanta is still ongoing, this is probably the most tentative entry on the list. Earn *always* has lower to fall.
- Ruby and Sapphire
- Hellboy and Liz
- The Monarch and Doctor Girlfriend
- Dante and Beatrice
  - Dante only narrowly nudging out Lemony Snicket here
- Cecil and Elliot
- Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice
- Bill and Frances
  - Yeah, I'm back and forth on this one, too, seeing as, how, well, not to spoil the ending, but, yeah.
  - The thing is, I think it was real, for whatever brief moment they had, before fate and folly tore them apart. Like JFK and Jackie, or Lisa and Dracula, or Kumar and Bag of Weed.
- Scud and Sussudio
- Adam and Eve (sure, why not)
- Jack and Ennis
- James and Azumi
- Ned and Chuck
- Kelvin and Hari
  - Solaris is the film that I feel may have best crystallized the true meaning of love for me.
- Catherine and Heathcliff
- Lisa and Dracula
- Han and Leia
- Bonnibel and Marceline
- Lily and James
- Lupin and Tonks
- Isaac and Miria
- Jacuzzi and Nice
