# Camp Papalima

a little [Operation Trapper Keeper][OTK] squad outpost for merging in petlogs to notes.stuartpb.com

## A note on the (pre)history of petlogs that should be kept somewhere

(that "somewhere" will probably become here, as the sections below dissolve to elsewhere and this page becomes the History Force outpost for petlogs)

The origins of my petlogs lie in GitHub, so the story of how they were all merged in lives with the archived repo: https://github.com/stuartpb/petlogs/issues/1

The thought to merge this in came in on [this page](7d504fda-8d04-4ac9-9332-319dd52b1930.md), which is somehow orphaned. It looks like it was originally (going to be) part of the News page? anyway, it's here now, and we need to get orphan-checking-before-commits enabled

The continuation of that, through to being merged into this repo, is documented [on this page][petlog merge log].

## what's left to do

splitting up the old README into a bunch of nodes that are more and less relevant today (ie. the stuff describing the directory structure vs. the idea of tracking mutable state), and each whose relevance can change over time (ie Style Guide may have a comeback, spec philosophy like "why there's no use in titling journal entries in filenames" probably less so)

also, retiring the YAML metadata blocks that don't get me much would be cool

## thoughts reflecting in postmortem on petlogs' structure

it's amazing how often "invent a new YAML spec with each document and no specific use case in mind" turns into a clusterfuck of [My Old Bad Ideas][], where the data is almost all irrelevant - and how that metadata is... still pretty attainable, slicing *as relevant*, in a neural bagtent structure
