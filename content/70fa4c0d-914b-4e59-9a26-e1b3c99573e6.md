# bagtent Manual of Markdown Style

This is the manual of style I follow for Markdown syntax in my notes to help with tooling.

More thoughts on what should go here live in [this old Quest page](2015dc83-db74-4f1f-a089-d07c3bd38dc1.md).

I'll probably make a separate style guide for my other Markdown conventions (like only using asterisks for emphasis) later.

- On writing links:
  - [Inlining links](a4e46084-4a99-4eee-a40a-794ddcdbf1d8.md)
    - Recommended in most cases
  - [Best Practices for Footlinks](9ff2ea44-fd1c-4b11-a075-1956f9f8784a.md)
    - For the exceptions and edge cases

## historical note

pruned off from [the original bagtent ramble][mound] - most threads from there have probably been severed
