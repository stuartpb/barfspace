# The Rest

This page is meant to be an incubator for pages that don't have a page where they would fit in right now (or pages we just can't figure out what do do with).

## list of pages that defy listing elsewhere

- [this idea for some VR interaction stuff](zgfdh-55mqf-gb94q-jg6j8-se3v3), not quite a project, but not quite a musing or a shitpost or speculative process
- while we're on the subject, [this page](5t3mg-9fbhp-t29rc-ezsx7-k19ws) hasn't really been satisfactorily woven into anywhere yet
- should come to understand [this CSS quirk](04rp4-y481x-8h82q-rfma8-48kg0)
- [miscellaneous trivia question ideas](f5ypv-5d0fg-4za3d-rwh70-7qhzc)
- [one way of thinking about the Halting Problem](fncdq-raxa7-pea43-axv78-sfz3z)
- [a tip-of-my-tongue description of something I remember reading a bit of](m8a1y-ag34s-8a8fx-3mng6-wcraz)
  - this should maybe go in a "Lost and Found", where I can keep all kinds of standing things I remember seeing/writing but haven't found
- [an idea for securing .internal domains](p1xa6-95chp-wd9km-pgvm8-hd2wa)
- [Why Filenames are the Real Handles](vn0wg-xddcj-mk8ff-xsz61-x1xw8)
  - a really useful Linux etal filesystem model concept explainer (ie. "why so many writes are actually renames")
