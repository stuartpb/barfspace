# A Modern Version of the Glass Tubes Vision

So, like, I'd have it as something like the Kubernetes documentation with Katacoda or whatever, and the LXC Try-it page

you could even have it be choose-your-won-adventure style. And I guess it transitions by triggers based on the output it sees coming out of your commands' stdout and/or stderr?

that feels like it'd be a fun thing for YAML frontmatter, "match conditions for transition triggers". And I guess you'd have something like shebangs for "autofill this from the CLI"

one thing I was thinking is that it'd be neat if the text auto-said things like "It looks like you have 3 services that are yadda yadda" - I guess I'm thinking more along the lines of, like, Helm's NOTES templating
