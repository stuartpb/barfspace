# Snot Humility

I have a problem with a certain kind of teaching.

It's the "oh, don't be too hard on yourself for not getting this, it's tricky stuff" school of methodology.

This is just a way of the teacher avoiding get caught at being bad at their job. They're stil shifting the blame to the student; they're just doing it in a twisted, like, Stepford way, where they're being "nice" about it.

My *real* problem with it is that, well, there's a problem I have with it about how having a problem with it gets pushback, but the *bigger* problem I have with it is as a *student*.

For context, I'm thinking specifically off of what I wrote here: https://github.com/stuartpb/github-mistakes/issues/13#issuecomment-358902036

Using Git as my specific example, the problem with saying "Oh, it's okay to not understand Git, it's very complex" is that Git's *not* very complex - and treating it like it *is* leads to the student thinking there's something *more there than there is*.

It *inhibits a proper understanding of the material*, filling the void in their understanding with demons and spirits. Think "Design of Everyday Things": it's giving the documentation a *friendlier voice*, when the solution should have been to *not obscure the working with documentation*.
