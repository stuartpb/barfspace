# A Million Ways to Set Up Kubernetes

A Kubernetes node is a system that can run containers in a runtime like Docker, and manage the network for all those containers.

TODO: describe what things Kubernetes setup does (I think [Kubernetes the Hard Way][] does this?)

[Kubernetes the Hard Way]: https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way

Kelsey Hightower himself explained this to me at one point, so I shouldn't be *hopelessly* lost

https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/cluster-lifecycle/self-hosted-kubernetes.md kind of covers this? sort of?

## minikube

Minikube uses Docker Machine to provision a new VM via:

- VirtualBox
  - This is the default, pretty much just because it works on all 3 platforms
- KVM
  - This is the most efficient VM solution for Linux


It can also use the host OS, but you don't generally want to do that unless your machine is dedicated to Kubernetes, [for all the reasons laid out in the docs](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/blob/master/docs/vmdriver-none.md#can-the-none-driver-be-used-outside-of-a-vm):

- [Needs to be run as root](https://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/issues/3760)
  - but not always
- Puts binaries directly into `/usr`, the land where only your package manager should work
  - As far as I can tell this is the only reason for the need to run as root
  - I guess moving things into a subdirectory is too much to ask?
- Everything binds to all the system's network interfaces
- No resource encapsulation
- Injects its DNS server into your system resolver configuration
- minikube assumes it's the only thing managing containers
- A bunch of minikube stuff doesn't work
  - Some of this makes sense (there's no need to tunnel or mount, for instance)
  - Some of it's just because of broken assumptions (I can't see why dashboard shouldn't work)
