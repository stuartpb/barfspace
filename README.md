# barfspace

This is a repository of works-in-progress and other not-ready-for-primetime writing that I do.

I had previously kept a few of these as uncomitted files in my workspace for [Meditations][], back before they were merged into [Lean Notes][] (not comitting them because I felt they weren't finished enough to publish), but eventually decided I'd rather maintain them in a perpetual work-in-progress repository.

All of the content in this repository can be found by follwing links from at least one of the following pages:

- [Musings][], a home for the kinds of aforementioned not-ready-for-prime-time meditations barfspace was originally created for
- [Project ideas][projects]
- [Rage Against Late-Stage Capitalism][lsc], [Angst][], and just straight up [Rants][]
- [Silly shit][]
- [Big Ambitious Titles][big]
- [the barfspace meta collection][meta], containing files that were kept separate in a directory called "docs" back when most of the content lived in named files at the root
- [The Rest][]: unclassifiable thoughts that are finally added to this list so that they're not dangling unreferenced

There was also a [scrapyard][] file that was meant to stand out from the rest of these.

hey I never said any of these were supposed to be any good, the whole point is just to have a place to put stuff in the hopes that some day it may spontaneously become Good Content

## Also

I'm putting [my-old-bad-ideas.md][] right *here* right now, because it should really be expanded once I've finished mutating the hierarchy like this and have a bit of a better writing-about-barfspace situation set up than the old "docs" folder
