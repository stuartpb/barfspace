# on petlogs and news

the petlogs woud work better if they were merged into this repo

They'd work better because they all just generally work like [News][], complete with being potentially applicable in different contexts and needing to link out to other junctions

[News]: nz7tm-y7ffr-mya5t-gbbhx-bnxyq

I'll probably do this on stushiba
