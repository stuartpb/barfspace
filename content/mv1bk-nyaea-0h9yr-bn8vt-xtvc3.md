# Peak Bullshit: The Fall of a Stupid Society as Reality Comes to Roost

> For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled.

## The Stock Market Has No Clothes

The thing about basing your entire economy around a stock market of hypothetical transactions is that it rewards people for making all their decisions based on what they think other people will think

## examples

- Everything Donald Trump touches is all about appearances to the detriment of reality:
  - the coup attempt in Venezuela that the firm involved *live-tweeted*, because every operation they'd ever conducted was a PR stunt
- that NHS contact-tracing app that only works for five minutes, and only from an iPhone to an Android phone due to platform privacy protections

> Good evening. Today is Wednesday, September the 24th, and this is my last broadcast. Yesterday I announced on this program that I was going to commit public suicide, admittedly an act of madness. Well, I'll tell you what happened: I just ran out of bullshit. Am I still on the air? I really don't know any other way to say it other than I just ran out of bullshit. Bullshit is all the reasons we give for living. And if we can't think up any reasons of our own, we always have the God bullshit. We don't know why we're going through all this pointless pain, humiliation, decays, so there better be someone somewhere who does know. That's the God bullshit. And then, there's the noble man bullshit; that man is a noble creature that can order his own world; who needs God? Well, if there's anybody out there that can look around this demented slaughterhouse of a world we live in and tell me that man is a noble creature, believe me: That man is full of bullshit. I don't have anything going for me. I haven't got any kids. And I was married for thirty-three years of shrill, shrieking fraud. So I don't have any bullshit left. I just ran out of it, you see.
