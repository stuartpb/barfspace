# Another excised musing about organic growth and the nature of thinking versus creation

There was a task in "Dividing Up the New World" in the Barfspace Operations (early quest list that preceded the Department of Barfspace) for "Write somewhere (in the neighborhood of [metaquiddity][] or [the meta collection][]) about how it's totally natural for more layers of indirection to organically emerge like this"

[metaquiddity]: 7vrfz-hc1hv-1pbx4-0ahfb-eq1wr
[the meta collection]: hhd1t-c4qv4-wn8bf-nps2x-5fcjs

There was a subtask beneath that: Shout out to the tree down by the "Everything I Know" or whatever quest in the [Mindfulness Arc][], which is doing this same sort of layer-forming

[Mindfulness Arc]: 423z3-ntnzb-cba98-01wkc-5f427

The rest were listed as checkbox items beneath that:

Like, ultimately, this is part of my overall intent with the Meta Collection to capture my meditations on writing in this repo, and how they echo out in the world around me

Should loop in that one XKCD somewhere around here about [an entire system just existing to maintain itself][xkcd 1579], because I know that's definitely a mania thing I take care to avoid

another xkcd that captures what it's like to have truly unbridled organic development: [xkcd 1360][]
