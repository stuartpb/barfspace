# Stubernetes Gem Cluster Attempt 2020-09-04

SSHing into the non-sturl systems and doing a `kubeadm reset`: it all looks like this

```
stuby:~ # kubeadm reset
[reset] WARNING: Changes made to this host by 'kubeadm init' or 'kubeadm join' will be reverted.
[reset] Are you sure you want to proceed? [y/N]: y
[preflight] Running pre-flight checks
W0904 21:31:11.623860   20617 removeetcdmember.go:79] [reset] No kubeadm config, using etcd pod spec to get data directory
[reset] No etcd config found. Assuming external etcd
[reset] Please, manually reset etcd to prevent further issues
[reset] Stopping the kubelet service
[reset] Unmounting mounted directories in "/var/lib/kubelet"
[reset] Deleting contents of config directories: [/etc/kubernetes/manifests /etc/kubernetes/pki]
[reset] Deleting files: [/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf /etc/kubernetes/bootstrap-kubelet.conf /etc/kubernetes/controller-manager.conf /etc/kubernetes/scheduler.conf]
[reset] Deleting contents of stateful directories: [/var/lib/kubelet /var/lib/dockershim /var/run/kubernetes /var/lib/cni]

The reset process does not clean CNI configuration. To do so, you must remove /etc/cni/net.d

The reset process does not reset or clean up iptables rules or IPVS tables.
If you wish to reset iptables, you must do so manually by using the "iptables" command.

If your cluster was setup to utilize IPVS, run ipvsadm --clear (or similar)
to reset your system's IPVS tables.

The reset process does not clean your kubeconfig files and you must remove them manually.
Please, check the contents of the $HOME/.kube/config file.
```

I don't do anything beyond that: there's stuff in `/etc/cni/net.d`, but it looks like it's just the Weave stuff that'll apply once the cluster is re-established anyway?
