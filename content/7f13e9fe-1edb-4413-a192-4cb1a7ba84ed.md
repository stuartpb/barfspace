# The Solder of Programming

Unix has all this crap where, like, if I run HEAD on a short file with no newline at the end, it's going to shove moy prompt over. That's bad UX - but it's *natural*. You could paper over it - but you'd be removing a layer.

Linux really is like a Prusa where Windows is like a cheap glued-shut 3D printer
