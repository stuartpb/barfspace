TODO: reconcile this with the stuff written in [Quests for the Network Neighborhood](8905d737-8f2a-4de7-a850-c1f2b04cd45e.md), which touches a lot of this stuff

- [The Clusterhood](9664b592-59ed-4ac5-bf15-9b67f67af111.md)
- the Praisefiles Network was kind of an idea like this
- [The Tech Guild Hall](11ad1cbd-34ea-4ca9-821b-6523c3fd86ac.md)
- a cypherpunks-or-programming-puzzles-and-code-golf-stack-exchange-like group that could be interested in [weird steganographic ideas](faaed29e-c3d1-4202-8bc7-d058e96af1cd.md)
