# Changes I'm thinking I'd like to make to some standing listings on the Unusual Studio Projects list

the Open Dictionary of Reserved Words should be redone as a Markdown repo, I think I settled on that a while ago

https://unusual.studio/projects/#29b020ea-0851-4ca0-9e1f-87119fd2c71c has been specced out within bagtent since we flew out to Orlando

Bagtent should be a thing in this list

Timetress could be another one that could be worked into a schema in Bagtent

Should probably note that I know how I want to implement the CSS dimmer thing

Should also have context for why I want to make the open Perspective Quantities data set? Maybe it should be community-based, where folks can vote "practical" (ie. "length of a football field"), "intriguing" (ie. when it's an interesting factoid, but not one you'd readily be familiar with), or "boring" (when it's neither)

## pieces that are worked into the June Judgment

SACRED should be interwoven with my notes more

Writing the Ship should be moved into Notes, same probably goes for Gullibot

In fact, the old "Help Wanted" repo should just be turned into a note - and the new "Help Wanted" repo can just be about navigating the current mish-mash-hodge-podge
