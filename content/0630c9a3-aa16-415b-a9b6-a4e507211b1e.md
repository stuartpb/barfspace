# exploring if there's a better way to do images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/ indicates that kubernetes doesn't really disrupt the docker image-registry paradigm, which sucks, and makes one of the current open questions with Plusku ("how should I do build images") all that much harder

cri-o suggests the possibility of other image formats at some point in the future so that's probably a point to watch

Might be possible to just run a registry "in-cluster" a la https://medium.com/@jmarhee/deploying-a-docker-registry-with-persistent-storage-and-local-only-access-on-your-kubernetes-1c6470d3611c

could also do "pre-pulling" for running an image built on the host which just sounds dicey and difficult https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#pre-pulling-images

https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod is definitely the way to interface
