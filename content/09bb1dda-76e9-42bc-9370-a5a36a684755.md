# Understanding Lua Season 2: TRON AS COSMOS

> The Grid. A digital frontier. I tried to picture clusters of information as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships? Motorcycles? Were the circuits like freeways? I kept dreaming of a world I thought I'd never see. And then one day... [I got in.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=43nr4E5kKRg&list=PLue_k3rjMkaAxEHRjNCdjL5XVJUsUU0Sx&index=2)

This could be the larger framing of Understanding Lua: going outside the environment, to show it's a process, in a container, in a pod, on the kernel, on a node, in a cluster, in a subnet, on the Internet.

And you'd keep a sense of wonder as you explore all this, as it does, ultimately, make up "the system" that constitutes all technology today (!!)

## So, tying this in to the Understanding Lua Room

We could maybe have a window foreshadowing this in parts of scripting that explore Network Transmission.

We'd have the mind blower be at the end of the season, when I open the door, and there's a lobby, and then a hallway of all different rooms (representing the Namespace), and a pneumatic tube (representing the Kubernetes API), and an elevator (for traveling to all namespaces)

Now, not all systems have Pods and Containers, but processes, files? these are universal

And so network communication is like mail: it can sent within the building over this pneumatic system, and we send a guy to the router if it's not in the building, or to the Gateway if it's not in our subnet

## OS facilities in Understanding Lua

Like, maybe there's a phone for when you start a process and keep the handle and can pipe streams into it?

Or maybe that's a construct for internal sockets?

the "Filesystem" is definitely a little space that opens up through a portal gun the filesystem functions access

and we use Volumes to explain where those wormholes open up to
