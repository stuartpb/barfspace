# Department of Barfspace

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way.

It'll also probably turn into a nexus for the codification of processes that get followed in these notes somewhat? IDK, that might be implying more cohesion to this editing than can ever really be hoped for

For the origins of the "Barfspace" name, see [the README node for the earlier "barfspace" incarnation of the notes' repo][OBR].

## The Quests

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests][] was eventually divided up into three "domains":

- [Barfspace Operations][], dealing with legacies, maintenance and the like
- [Barfspace Visions][], dealing with new explanatory content and structure, aspirations like that
- [Barfspace Implementations][], dealing with tooling etc

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md
[Barfspace Operations]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[Barfspace Visions]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md
[Barfspace Implementations]: 30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md

These are kind of... artifact-y, as a lot of them are kind of... inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

In fact...

The more I think about it, the more I think Barfspace Visions should be broken into subpages that are all kept in a section here, as well as Operations (which would get integrated into the list below). The pages can list the thesis of each of these "divisions", and all the content can live in linkable subpages.

Maybe in a new commit soon. (actually, eh whatever I'll start doing it now)
