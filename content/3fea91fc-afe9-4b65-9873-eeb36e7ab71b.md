a lot of disk stuff seems to be going really slow for some reason

## MSYS2

running `pacman -Syu` and doing the whole close-window-mid-process-to-finalize thing that still feels super hacky and weird, then doing it again

"checking available disk space" takes a REALLY long time for some reason

## Windows Subsystem for Linux

Opened `bash` and immediately had it say "Performing one-time upgrade of the Windows Subsystem for Linux file system for this distribution..."
