# Content Editor project ideas

Of one kind or another, here are a few idea clusters I have that could be described as "editors":

## My projects

- [wayside](46qjk-agdzr-a58ez-vypmf-3hxay)
  - often overlapping [windowsystem metabrowser](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k)
  - [Workspace Pod Manager for Kubernetes](64g19-6195p-93apg-pnxte-2tpg8)
- the [floating AR pages idea](145g4-r763p-8d80c-fth7d-84aet) is kind of like a Bagtent-y concept
- other kind of loose idea(s):
  - [limited-smartness text model](9nynz-h0161-ckah4-3mmyv-sz2m1)
- [penciltape](3gda5-8dfws-cb869-jmc9z-sg26j)
- [A nice hex editor](d2xmj-z49kx-e580m-s0t4n-8phrb) (currently entangled with other thoughts)
- [Therblig-based Bot Programmer](sj52m-tcxy3-grars-pb82m-zan8h) for [robotics](9s0en-bqhj7-25a3d-xw20h-f1rgg)
- [boxesin](2wd2c-5w943-qsarv-b4h38-26p0f) was a loose content model that's inspired newer ideas
- [Abstract Pipeline Runner](amyvx-h7853-878ea-s47wv-a18p1)
  - [Magickshop](eqwj9-t864t-jta25-3deyj-1xvq3)
  - [Acebins](47fbb-38jaq-rgax3-sy87n-0vemw)
- [Video compositor / converter / editor](t86d2-9jaa0-ch8ff-fpwms-k0g2r)
- [Extremely Simple Editing Implementation](1q00a-xk405-x9am8-ejp0v-jqm0y)
- [Deep Zoom / 2D Big Web "Red String Room"](rgvet-f9pds-01985-jef45-ywyew)

## bagtent browsers that may have editing

See [Bagtent Human Interface](pz4va-mx94c-ca9ew-py41b-5e1jp) notes, especially around [authoring](w744d-0ekjn-8k83g-937xd-vbez3).

## Outside projects

- [existing editors I'm checking out](peejv-w0xm5-ry9kg-z2x2s-bxtw5)

## kind of related

- the [Notestack Core](63p2w-vj7t2-baaa8-r76as-nntma) wants a good editor

## more places to look

Note that the Notestack Core also explores content editing tooling, including smaller-scale experiments like the git shotclock and publishing-side pipeline considerations, and
