# Brand for Kubernetes lab projects

I need an entity umbrella like Bitnami / Rancher / CoreOS for all the Kubernetes stuff I'm building

Specifically, if I want to run my own registry

Some words I'm looking at:

- Box
- Can
- Ship
- Hive
- Bay
- Cloud

Partial words:

- (Com)mand
- Serv(er)

Hey wait, I could just use "pluskube"! just for the apps if nothing else
