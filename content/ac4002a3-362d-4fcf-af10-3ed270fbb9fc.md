# Kublam

an annotation/CRD-linkable-by-annotations that just names the GitHub issue responsible for why a resource is so fucked, and a service that runs through your cluster to see if any of those issues have been fixed and notifies you

call it "kublam.moe"

## High concept

Kublam is for monitoring qualitative shifts in the tech behind a Kubernetes cluster, and then notifying humans / altering cluster resources in response.

## Scope

[Kublam Is Not](c3978bb1-e9df-4f8e-be82-a7c787f0afe2.md)

## Prior art?

I feel like this is obvious enough that someone's already made something like it?

The thing that would make me pursue this design is that I get the feeling whatever's out there that's capable of this kind of thing is also probably integrated with some monolithic CI/issue-tracker that predates Kubernetes and doesn't work particularly smoothly with it, like OpenShift or whatever

Hence why the reduced scope is so important: it's this refusal to expand into that territory that differentiates Kublam from ecosystem-scale
