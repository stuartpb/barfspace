# The Inline Rock

This was [the addition I made](rmb77-qdmnq-828jq-ba8fx-xbe8k) to [the old recommendation for footnames](fwyrz-f37q8-m790b-qsca1-0fmcf) that caused me to rethink the whole idea:

> I just wrote the Table of Contents for [Understanding Lua][], and I didn't even bother coming up with footnames for most of them - I just used inline links, since most of them were one-time and the name level of redirection didn't really help readability.

## Also

This list was pulled from [an old page calling for the collection of best practices](40axs-0yvek-sza12-egfgx-x73e1)

- Actually, inline links have a lot of advantages:
  - Don't need to worry about locality.
  - Don't need to (possibly) update footnames if you change the text in a link.
  - I think there might be more notes on this lingering around somewhere, I'll just remember to direct them here or to a subpage about it at some point in the future

These should really be moved into the modern page on [Inlining links](mkj61-12ak7-rea82-ks9qe-dqwer)
