I swear I remember this book, and it's stuck with me for years.

It factors into... both King High and Luc Curios, which I'm realizing now are the same story, remembered in two different drunken bouts gesturing at the same dream (remembered much more clearly as Luc Curios, but with more workable dialogue as King High)

I definitely remember it being a grpahic novel that I read the first scene of online

I'm confident I picked up from one of the big webcomics of the naughties, like qwantz or goats
