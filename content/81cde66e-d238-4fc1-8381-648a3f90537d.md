# The Root Note

Stuart P. Bentley's Notes are currently organized into a few loose "grand projects" that will or will not blend together over time:

- [barfspace][], the original top-level README for these notes, which contains some different classes of personal content
  - Some of the stuff that is currently under the barfspace node should eventually get promoted up here, probably
- [Lean Notes][], a series of notes sharing my expertise in various fields, which I tried to pursue across two orders:
  - [Table A][]
  - [Table B][]
  - Note that there are a couple more pages listed on the Lean Notes page that aren't listed on either of these tables.
- [The Fresh Book of Bell Air][FBBA], a Discordian rite within the larger Chaos
- [Pitches and Scripts][]
- [The Left Side of the Notes][fyidust]
- [Unusual Studio, Kind Of][job]

There's also [this page][GYST], which kind of covers the current state of the repository, and what I'm planning to do to clean it up.

There's also [this page][layout], which describes the overall layout of files in this repository (beyond the `content` directory), which was originally written on-the-fly when I was coming up with the structure for Lean Notes that would eventually turn into this repository.
