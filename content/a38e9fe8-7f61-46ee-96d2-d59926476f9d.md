# NFC (and some RFID, sort of)

This is just a little waypoint for stuff I'm looking into

I was thinking I might use an RFID antenna to add some functionality to my Magic Band Infinity Gauntlet, but I've now decided that it's not elaborate enough to merit that

I might be interested in the future, though, so I figure I'll stash some of the stuff I had opened

I also had Google searches open for various phrases combining some variation of "arduino detect nfc induction coil loop"

I might want to just ask "Can I use a GPIO to detect an NFC reader's induction?" as a question on Electronics Stack Exchange
