# just adhd things

here's a bunch of pages I've jotteed down when my ADHD is crushing me most

- [Breadth-First Hyperactivity Disorder](837900b6-8017-43f4-8a24-11c3d79b0283.md)
- [ADHD Is](3d542ea7-e0d5-47ac-8a2a-34ea350b7a76.md)
- [Vanishing Kingdoms](d330303d-77a2-4df7-9f98-3df639c515f8.md)
- [A Parallel Pipe with a Serial Spigot](d9275f1c-412c-40da-8bd0-ac4d80bd4513.md)
- [Everything Not Saved Will Be Lost](655072ec-6a00-4f6d-96ea-bf6517a2dd62.md) (contains meta description of the process of writing it and notes like it)
- [Writing Out of Time](18dffacd-6019-4a43-9c67-f36064fc4831.md)

[Worse is Better](8d87892e-c2dd-4be5-998e-0e0908a1e99b.md) tends to be an emergent theme around this stuff, too (it's kind of how you have to cope with it)
