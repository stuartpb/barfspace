# The Academy of Barfspace

The Academy of Barfspace is the standing institution tasked with assessing and perscribing what's going on (or supposed to be going on) around here.

Examining my process enough to codify it has a weird way of leading to me trying to draft new stronger rules for things I was only vaguely and inconsistently doing, so this work tends to trade back and forth between descriptive and perscriptive

For more of this kind of process-examination-and-specification, check out the [Spec Lab](9a2890e2-a0fa-4484-9c1e-3c7c7ec4f28a.md), which might get a joint-venture dedicated page for the describing-notes-as-they-work-in-this-repo documentation?

## Duties

- [Rolling Out the Welcome Wagon](203fa894-f598-474f-9777-0c39cc027599.md)
  - Making the [Visitor Center](434dd429-b16d-4924-996f-aaf2ebff29ef.md) into a workable tour or something.
- [How I'm Writing With Bagtent](13ceb37e-99d5-417b-be3c-ec7e1bc537ac.md)
- [Selling Bagtent](f0fd193c-ddaa-4d5d-80f6-001df5283ff1.md) (includes brainstorming new ways to use it)
- [Reflecting on Quests](a54a4a48-80eb-4d07-9fa3-b8ba13e9a9b8.md)
- [Developing Best Practices](2015dc83-db74-4f1f-a089-d07c3bd38dc1.md)
- [Federating Barfspace](abf92e6b-7ba0-41f3-b13a-63ec77133cf3.md)
- [Lean Notes and Linkdumps](1cd51f38-b2df-49a5-99ad-b5629b3083b0.md) (kind of an artifact these days)
- [The Quest in the Quotes](73bf679b-4732-4ed1-929d-5dce9c163fd7.md) (a weird cluster of thoughts that isn't really a quest)
- [Shorthand for Placeholders](c5840859-b706-4750-8a14-0ae006f91ffa.md) (very messy legacy "quest")

## The Philosophers

[what's bappin' with musings](8fa02640-b218-40d4-8948-18bf0d441b22.md) ought to expand to become a Philosophy Wing that extends into the whole of Musing/Meditation-space, with maybe a special joint contingent dedicated to the Philosophy of Barfspace.

I had this ["the meta page"](8c5a1d30-97d9-4395-85be-b6c8ba57b239.md) that will probably become the headquarters of that joint contingent, but first it has to hand off a bunch of artifacts to History Force

This also overlaps heavily with the Spec Lab work described above - "Operations" will probably take all the stuff that doesn't, and "Visions" can take all the stuff that does.
