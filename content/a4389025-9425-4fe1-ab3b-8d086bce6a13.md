# State of the Cluster

The cluster is a standar k3os installation with these changes made

- A static hostname has been set.
- My GitHub user has ssh key access.
- Deployment of servicelb is disabled, and `metallb` is installed.
- kubernetes-dashboard and kubeapps are installed.
  - The cluster name has been set to "Stubernetes" in the dashboard.
- The native `coredns` manifest has been replaced with a similar `cluster-dns`.
  - A stub manifest exists to recreate the `coredns` ConfigMap, to integrate a feature of k3s.
- The native local-volume-provisioner has been disabled and Longhorn has been installed from its Helm chart.
  - A udev rule to automount partitons with a specific UUID is added in config.yaml.
- The native `traefik` ingress has been replaced with a `household-ingress` app (based on Traefik's own Helm charts for Traefik 2) in `household-system`.
