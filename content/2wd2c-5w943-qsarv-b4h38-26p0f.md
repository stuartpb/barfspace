# boxesin and nesting data construction tools

https://unusual.studio/projects/#564a1c4a-ebd2-44ae-903c-284c78c5cd97

My "boxesin" idea was always kind of a loose concept - here are some projects that are better realizing its goals by incorporating other things I'm interested in:

- [borkflowy](n3ht7-s55td-078sn-zx3ny-z0b0q)
- [Squorum](g3018-t2t29-4p91w-34nep-jb4ap)

## also similar?

- Wouter van Oortmerssen's [TreeSheets](http://strlen.com/treesheets/) looks simlar to how I probably would have descrribed boxesin at one point (I havn't used it though because lol, wxwidgets, maybe if it were sandboxed)
