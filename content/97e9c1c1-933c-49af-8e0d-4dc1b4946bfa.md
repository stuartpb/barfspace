[Data wants to be free.](https://xkcd.com/1228/)

The Internet is a Big Blob of Data, or at least, it *has* one. You can call it "The Great Big Distributed Internet Data Mass" (kind of like The Great Pacific Ocean Plastic Garbage Mass or whatever).

I like that idea/term to describe "basically all reachable fixed data", like "Plain Old Telephone Service".

Data is incredibly fungible, it's incredible that people don't realize how arbitrarily emergent data can be. There are more interesting ways we can structure it than the ways we do now.

Also, decentralization and content indexing have the potential to be truly disruptive, you know, like that new internet idea that was the basis for the most recent season of Silicon Valley

This is about anti-censorship and freedom of information and also just making ops a lot less mandatory for publishing, you know?
