## Reworking the Far-Out End (Where the Sidewalk Ends)

Plans to rework [The Rest][], Appendices, and Loose Notes (and maybe more?)

The [previous section][TOTNE] is about redefining the *descriptive* stuff, this is about... the *intake*. I don't know how to describe the difference between these two plans, but it's there: they're not mutually exclusive, but they're not interlinked the way that the other is... augh. This is triggering [metaquiddity vertigo][].

I guess the idea is that here's what be best:

- A page for "this page would be in a category of its own, if we had more pages" stuff
  - Most of the things that can't be easily described in those terms should live over in the tumbly wing or around Musings
  - This would basically be what "The Rest" is right now
- Loose Notes, at the very end
  - maybe we'll just put our finger on the scale for that
  - or maybe we'll just suck it up and use random UUIDs like they're random and opaque like a gentleman
- A page for Appendices and Indices in General
  - The Rest being the catch-all Index and Loose Notes being a catch-all Appendix
  - I think the reason I didn't create a Loose Notes page initially is because I thought that's what [Cut Comments][] was going to be
- A page for general Categories / Mood Boards
  - This is an index at the top of the Indices? Or somewhere prominent, like maybe near the bottom, but not The Rest, because it's for indices that are fuzzier and more subject matter-y? whatever
- A Best Of page
  - the redevelopment plan for rehabilitating [this goofball][bofa]
  - ironically, since the Root Node really is essentially the closest I'll come to making a "best of" (because I only really like to highlight hubs and nexuses in practice), this became a nexus for the opposite - a "worst of", where lost pages could be stashed
- A "Tour" page to introduce and lead into the "Best Of"
  - That was what I started doing with [this][not-ln] before I got all mixed up
- The Barfspace Construction Plans page
