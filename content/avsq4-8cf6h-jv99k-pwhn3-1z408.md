# Natural Editor Support for Natural Markdown Semantics

lists really are a great workflow UI facility... you could present them with the hyphen (when typed and in-place as a list item) as a draggable handle (and right-clickable / double-clickable / ctrl+clickable / just clickable idk)

## what about headings?

- they're a nice way to escape the "list level" and go into "headings level" of the tree
  - did I have a thought about a structure like this in the past? like a translation format from markdown headings/lists to YAML?
    - definitely remember having a page about that somewhere around here
    - and how "paragraphs between lists" and "code block as the section's content" are also semantic data formats
