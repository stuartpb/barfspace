# Current thinking 2019-04-01

Okay, so, the first thing to getting a handle on what I have here is to open the site in another tab and navigate around via links, which I can't really do in the editor right now.

From there, I'm looking at the Right Now / News / Quests view, and I'm thinking I'm just gonna go ahead and collapse the remaining Right Now content into new Quest node / pages, and then just turn "Right Now" into, like, a descending list of updates across all those quests.

I'm dealing with [reconciling stuartpb.plan][planfile postmortem] right now
