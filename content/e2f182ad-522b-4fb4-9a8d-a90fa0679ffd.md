# The Dashseat metaphor

The original description of Understanding Lua when I made a GitHub repo for it was "A visual narrative of programming within the Dashseat metaphor".

## What is Dashseat supposed to be?

Dashseat *kind of* should have its own page? But the design is so heavily influenced by what I'm writing here that I see no real purpose in making one until I've got a clear design I'd want to make.

(The rest of this might be in the Background, I don't know.)

Anyway, "Dashseat" is supposed to be a VR program that would work the way Understanding Lua is described as being presented.
