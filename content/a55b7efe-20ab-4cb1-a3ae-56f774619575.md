# The Bloated Age

This was a repo I created a while back with the thesis "Finding Beauty in the Chaos and Excess of Late-Stage Capitalism".

It had one issue: "The Art from Adversity of Perpetual Copyright".

The idea here was that you sometimes find creativity from authors not being able to just use characters naturally. I noted "Alan Moore inventing Watchmen after being told that DC wouldn't let him use the Charleston Comics characters is probably one of the most classic examples."

I guess my point here is that *every* period of history has its grotesque characteristics, and there's always something you'll never see again when those grotesqueries are fixed. The world surely becomes a better place, but you'll never see a President sacrifice thousands to build another Great Pyramid, you know?

As that guy said in Life on Mars: "Yes, he was impressive, in his own way. But so were the dinosaurs."
