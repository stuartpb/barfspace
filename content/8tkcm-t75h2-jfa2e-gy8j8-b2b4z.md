## Previously

Once you've concerned yourself with [Being Searchable](t2y3s-av4yq-cabps-rgecj-7jfge), you'll probably want to track how searchable you are.

## Overture

This is all stuff you'd do to keep your ear to the ground and instrument your thing to respond to your users:

- Analytics
- Polling
- A/B testing

However, I have to say, I'm not a big believer in this stuff. I think the best way to listen to your uses is to *talk with them*, not to sneak around their hallways and put a stethescope on their door.

Metrics, projections: this way leads [The Dark Side](cfmcr-80jwh-4b9fg-hgp5p-swrwm). The only reason I'm including this kind of page at all is to hopefully steer kids going down that road to a path that's mostly harmless.

## Open-source Analytics

[Fathom](https://github.com/usefathom/fathom) seems like absolutely the way to go: it's self-hostable, and not as intrusive as Google Analytics.

They also have a hosted version.

There are others, but they're old and nasty and PHP-based.

https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-analytics has a whole list with very little curation.

## Telemetry

Not 100% sure how this is defined, but if it's referring to tracking your technical performance, [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) seems prettyy popular.
