# The Notegraph Historium

This is the division of the [Academy of Belfspace](a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md) that holds the artifacts and histories of the content of these notes.

The historium is divided into two fields:

- "The Greater History of How I Have Rolled", which can incorporate references to specific endeavors as examples, and incorporate artifacts. This covers everything outside these notes: work put together outside this tree since its creation is documented in cooperation with [The Beyonder Consulate](e1c5817b-ece2-47c1-a2bc-2fe6f082abc7.md)
  - [how-i-roll's Tomb](bbeba5e6-b56a-4a1d-9547-8241311e7cf2.md) may come to house this.
    - More likely, though, it'll become a little stub describing how how-i-roll held 4 files that moved to different places when the Notes Tree came to live
  - [this node](9e243c1d-4c37-4b69-9da5-e6e949f962fd.md) describes how I used to roll on GitHub, and was the one salient part to have ever been produced under how-i-roll that wasn't, in hindsight, unrelated (finding a far-flung location within these notes)
  - [this node on continuations from OneNote](8730a487-7d29-48d9-a197-5c90bd83df82.md) developed in conjunction with the [Deep Note Divers](acea3fb8-4b0d-434e-aefd-3a75ced4f0a2.md)
- the Walking Tour History of These Notes, which collects artifacts and links to where they were pulled from, and weaves into some of the other studies from the Academy

And, of course, content that moves in and/or out of these notes ends up spanning both fields, because Everything Is a Mess.
