# State of the Prototype

Or, "My Current Experiments in Printing Beads"

## Pearl print settings by position

All of these pearls are printed with:

- 100% infill
- 0 solid top/bottom layers
- Support enforced for the first 20 layers

Pearl 2/59 is printed with Rectilinear infill, 2 shells

Pearl 29/32 is printed with Concentric infill, 0 shells

Pearl 21/40 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 2 Shells

Pearl 10/51 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 1 Shell

Pearl 11/50 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 3 Shells

Pearl 20/41 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 4 Shells

Pearl 12/49 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 5 Shells

Pearl 19/42 is printed with Archimedean Chords, 6 shells

Pearl 3/58 is printed with Rectilinear infill, 6 shells

Pearl 28/33 is printed with 15 shells (negating infill) - this is different from 0 Shells Concentric Infill because it fills gaps.

Pearl 27/34 is printed with 15 shells and the first layer being 0.1mm.

Pearl 4/57 is the same (salvage from a test to see if this thinner first layer, which has negligible improvement, would lead to reliability issues).

## Next plans

## Bailed experiments

- Printing vertically. Surprisingly, this made it *harder* to snap the halves together.
- Hilbert or Octagram Spiral fills. The Hilbert one was just too refractive, and I could tell I'd have the same issues on Octagram
