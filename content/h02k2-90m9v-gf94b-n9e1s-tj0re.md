# Leaks You Might Not Have Thought Of

I remember I think Scoble unlocked his phone on stream once, meaning his gesture had leaked

It would have been so much worse if he'd logged in with his account password, though!

Even if we didn't see his thumbs, being able to see the timing of the keystrokes is a big deal

I noted this in the design of surpass: knowing the timing of keystrokes, according to a study that eventually impacted the design of the ssh protocol (or at least mosh), siginificantly lowers the attack space for passwords

what's worse, even if you hide it on-screen, if your screencast includes audio, we can still potentially hear the keyboard. I shudder to think what potential for triangulation lies in a streaming setup with a stereo webcam mic or similar- even two mikes muxed to mono would probably leak some kind of waveform, especially if signatures could be developed for known on-screen keystrokes

and of course then there's TEMPEST and all other sorts of wacky radar-dish shit, and then there's the matter of wiretaps and keyloggers and secret agents standing right behind you
