# You Do Not Exist / Twelvey Eighty Four

A freaky, dystopial parable that kind of remixes a lot of Black Mirror themes, and echoes the whole nightmare that is the burgeoning field of adversarial neural networks, as well as movies like Moon and Terminator.

So, it starts out, the protagonist arives at his new foster community, after his parents just died in a... shit, let's say it's a protest of the government

so basically everybody has their own faked ANN between each other's online communication, and their own fake outside world, immaculately designed to be communicated in a clear enough Rashomon to the people they're most likely to interact with offline

different groups have different comprehensions of the order of magnitude of the fake histories they've been endowed with, based on the shit leader's brain decaying some long time ago and saying "it's twelvey eighty four", and then the news shattered as each splinter tried to invent its own rationalization for how that wasn't a slip of the tongue (and, you know, nonsense coming out of a rotten brain) like some think the year is "one thousand two hundred twelve", some think it's "twelve octaquadrillion" (ie. "12e84" or 12*10^84), some think it's 0x12e84 (ie. 77444), some think it's 0xc84 (ie. 3204), and then there's the "extra Es" variants: 0x12e8e4, 0xce84, etc...

or it's 12084 and he meant "twelvety"

## lighter version

What if you set this right at the point when newspapers are no longer on newsstands, and everybody gets their own personalized newspaper, and a couple neighbors come to the realization that they're also getting personalized news. At first, it's just stylistic, then it's framing, then it's outright distorting facts and inventing events that never happened
