# Markdown-First Kubernetes Notebook Literate Monster Blob

Or just a dynamic templating system strong enough to supplant that compoent of Helm, as well as be appropriate enoutgh to extend down into specifying dynamic / custom-element frontend templates. Microservice defintions are modeled as "simple enough" (just a file that defines a container image to add, like, one script to)

This covers a lot of ideas I had before bed the night of June 5, 2020

- [Adventure Formatting](2epdy-fdwqe-bwam3-jddaz-ghbc2)
  - turns into an exploration of generalized document-to-HTML mapping using "only frontmatter"
  - you can even think of a document as defining a "route", which returns the content of the static page
    - and that would be implied by some kind of base template establishing this
      - like "all Markdown files should be interpreted as the response to a GET by default"

- [generalizing a view of dynamic templates](45wb7-wyq86-hk9rs-jccr8-9bbgr)
  - this comes closest to describing a runtime model and the Windowsystem Metabrowser
  - [Lost in the Weeds](rbxy3-74n7t-w99td-wgg5k-6snrw)
    - this kind of reiterates the "Literat File Creation" idea
