# really cool apartment dream

so I took a nap today because I was recounting the abuse I'd been going through for the past year and it wore me down

I had been [vadding][] around this big prominent canyon in Seattle and I found this secret offshoot off a corridor in a cavernous tunnel and I found this really cool apartment, like [Planetologist]'s condo, but it was underground and there were stalactites and everything, it was like Minecraft it was so unexpected

I was exploring the hidden valleys et al on foot because I'd had this really scary dream where I got on the bus and the driver started getting suicidal and driving real fast on a narrow windy bridge

kind of like the Fremont Cut / Lake Washington Ship Canal

and there's like seven apartments arranged in a circle around this, like, semi-directional ampitheater, with offshoots... it kind of reminds me of that one adventure game about the talking corn, I wanna say "Maize!"?

Anyway I start sort of stopping in and hanging out there using it like a waypoint thinking it's deserted or abandoned or something (because the door's always unlocked and I never see anybody there), even though the apartment's pretty well kept and all evidence suggests someone has been there recently

Then one day I'm hanging out there doing my thing and a whole bunch of the coolest people I know like [Deliverable] walk in, and I think I had [Painlessness] with me, and she and I were like "hi, guys, uh, we didn't know you owned the place", but, like, we kind of knew these folks

it's kind of like I've envisioned [Nandrolone] (TODO: find out this guy's familiar name) living (except for the whole underground bunker thing)

and then it turns out there's always been a guy there, but he's been sleeping this whole time, and it's Ezra Miller, this is just where he lives apparently, he's like Vincent Kartheiser like that

anyway it turns out they all have a band, and Ezra Miller has the deed for the place because his dad (who I think I thought was Brendan Gleason or something) filmed this FMV video game (like Command and Conquer or something) there some time in the Nineties, and they'd carved out this whole awesome cavern hideout for the set, then over the course of filming he'd looked into property prices, and become attached to the set

It's also kind of like how people are converting missile silos into apartments now

and then the band started to play and I felt bad because I couldn't play an instrument, but then I remembered I sing an awesome David Byrne, so we all started making music together, me just going my goofy Talking Heads voice, but having fun with the band

and then I woke up, refreshed and restored.
