# State of the Prototype

The necklace is now fully beaded. For future reference, consult the [Beading Record](4a3f9419-5682-4b52-a9b5-1db294844c6f.md) for experiments that were run when printing beads (and where they were placed).

My new concern is [wiring and casing](ac931713-9adf-4398-8bcd-111b7bd39c99.md).
