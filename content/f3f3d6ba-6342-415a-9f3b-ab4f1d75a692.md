# THE GREAT MERGE PLAN OF DECEMBER 2018

I'm hijacking this page, because, honestly, its presence is what catalyzed this entire idea for me.

Also, it's had no title for a while, and, honestly, I'm pretty sure this was the destiny I had in mind for it, which is why it's not linked in any of barfspace's content, just the current README

Though it should now be registered with the [Department of Development][DoD]

[DoD]: eb1e81f8-5939-4f85-9930-418044018a75.md

## Motivations

[everything I originally tried to write about what the barfspace experiment was enabling for me][bsmc]

## STUFF ABOUT THE PLAN

- The README is going to be turned into just a brief explainer that these are my personal notes
  - You are not expected to understand these, they are primarily just public to make it so it's as hard for me to lose my notes as possible
  - That you might be able to read them is a useful benefit that I may inconsistently cater to at times
  - When I'm trying to make them accessible, it's as much about making it so I don't forget myself when I come back and try to read them later, if not more, than about making them accessible to others
  - They're like code comments like that
  - These are a constantly-updating set of documents, unless stated otherwise
  - Feel free to get your own ideas from these notes, but don't go attributing anything more than the words to me
- The stuff in Lean Notes' README is going to get moved to a note
- The stuff in Barfspace's current README is going to get moved to a note, too, one that links to Lean Notes' old README as a kind of "oh, here's this whole other website just hanging out inside this one"
- The latter will become the "current root note" linked in the README, after the explainer of how it's just my notes
  - At the end: "With all these disclaimers out of the way, Click here to proceed to the current root note."
  - This part of the refactor might actually come before any of the merging stuff happens
- the barfspace repo will then be renamed notes.stuartpb.com
  - and the CNAME will change, obviously
- actually, I think barf.space should continue to live as its own repo...
  - okay, I'll make a new one for barf.space (since this one is currently "barfspace") that can be a born-stub with a README that just tells the story of Project Barfspace, and how it turned into my notes, and how there's a few pages that point toward what Barfspace is meant to embody within those notes
  - It's bigger than any one body of text, really... it's an idea, like "the Web" or "the Collective Unconscious", of all the ideas that don't quite make sense in words, but do have a cogent and effective purpose, a right to exist in the world.
  - It's magic. Barf magic.
- a bunch of other stuff that wasn't merged into Lean Notes is gonna need to get merged into here
  - the big one on my mind is Pitches and Scripts, because that's been like the Meditations that led to Barfspace in that I've had a bunch of tenuous and uncommitted files I wasn't confident enough in

It's funny: the consistent theme of all these bad ideas is that I was convinced that the thing inhibiting my creativity was the lack of a venue for it.

Though, actually, come to think of it... was I wrong? I mean, that's essentially what it took: look at how my output *exploded* once I found Cloud9.

So I guess it's actually kind of sad.

But yeah, another thing, as I put for an idea originally written down as "A Federated Wiki of StackOverflow-type questions answered with Octopress-type posts.":

> This seemed like a smart idea when I wrote it, but looking back, it's redundant to... Stack Overflow questions and Octopress posts. This idea failed one of the criteria I've only really come to understand in the last few years: "is there anything stopping the kind of user who'd know what to do with this from doing it themselves today?"

*(Update: in light of [what I'm doing right now with Lean Notes][leannotes#2] where I'm effectively turning it into a federated wiki of guides, that last one is especially hilarious)*
