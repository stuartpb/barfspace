# NodeMCU stuff on stushiba

I somehow didn't have wget installed until today to do the NodeMCU stuff, wild (also installing gperf)

having an issue where /dev/ttyUSB0 isn't showing up, gonna reboot

error was fixed after reboot. It might be worth figuring out the causes of this issue if I want to update my Prusa's firmware again

running `make menuconfig` per https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-firmware/blob/dev-esp32/docs/build.md

changing python2 path to "python2"

started enabling bluetooth then noticed there doesn't appear to be any NodeMCU stuff for it

enabling modules: bit, crypto, encoder, SPI, WS2812, time

ran into an issue with pyserial, doing `sudo pacman -S python2-pyserial` to fix it

ran into a problem with future so I installed python2-future as well
