# 3D Printer Pen Plotting

I've done some work trying to get my Prusa to work as a plotter

The [Tool Grate](87vaq-3shgy-80aem-khnkr-qk4t4) is the current base interface I'm using to attach plotting tools to my print head - it's pretty neat.

see also [Sharpiecore](v2sj6-ejqmr-c0agg-y0z3v-jjvg3), an alternative use for Sharpies

## Generating plots

- https://3dwriter.io/ is what I used to make gcode for written text
