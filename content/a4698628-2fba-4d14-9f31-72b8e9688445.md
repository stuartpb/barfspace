The pitch: it's like a Fediverse version of Facebook timelines, but each kind of media that can appear in the TL has its own module, and users are encouraged to build new ones

Like, honestly, Twine's whole weird-ass Format thing is the biggest influence on what I'm thinking with this, in many ways.

An example is, like, a widget for publishing Perspective Quantities, like what the QI account does sometimes, and then users can report back if the data point is useful or interesting or whatever. There are enough factors that there's worth throwing some UI / data structure in it, but... not enough to warrant its own community portal

This'd also be more adaptable to new developments in how people interact?
