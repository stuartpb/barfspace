# Luc Curios

A story of hope, based on anxieties, based on realities, based on daydreams, based on nightmares, based on The Truth.

## Act One: Life Before Death

How Luc Curios got sick, and why he thought he was getting better

## Intermezzo: The Indeterminate Nature of Death

On the bureaucracy and medical confusion of being classified as dead when your mind still appears to function - a bizzare inversion of the Cotard delusion

## Act Two: Life After Death

On watching a world you already built rebuild itself without you, from the outside looking in
