# The Two-Layer Rule

A trend that's been emerging is, if I need a third-layer heading, I need to make a new page. (like right here, for instance, where I should really be putting this on a newly-conjured page, but am not doing so because I'm tired and I don't want to toggle tabs and copy-paste UUIDs right now).

This would dovetail neatly with equals-and-hyphen-headings, actually. I might consider that (though... hey, that'd mean I have to rework a lot of my parsing assumptions, d'oh).
