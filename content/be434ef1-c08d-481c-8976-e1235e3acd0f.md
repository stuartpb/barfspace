# Dual-Extruder "Purge Shadows"?

If you had a dual-extruder setup and a Prusa MMU2 situation, could you design your GCode so that material transitions / purges happen on a tower to the sides of the model, purged as the other extruder prints directly?

I feel like this could maybe be really interesting with a "purge filament system"

nah, I don't think there's savings to be had here from a Makerbot dual-extruder model. (Though I'm still on the lookout for examples where that could actually work.)

## getting corexy-interchangeable-toolend fancy with it

what if you had two *floating* hotends, though? And a stationary "secondary extruder" that only feeds cleaning filament (or the selected filament for a new transition) into a purge bucket
