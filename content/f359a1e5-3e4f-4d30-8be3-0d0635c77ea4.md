## stuartpb.plan

This was an experiment I tried for the first couple months of 2018. https://github.com/stuartpb/stuartpb.plan/blob/master/readme.md

The main issue that made me stop updating PLAN.md was that it wasn't allowed to sprawl in scope the way that Barfspace is, meaning that if I still liked something that I had written there, even though it wasn't really relevant, but it also wasn't obsolete, I couldn't just leave it there.

This is why I'm so stoked about the whole [bagtent][] model, really.

There were other issues - the pressure to leave emo stuff in my personal life out of the Git history, the sheer size of the content I eventually would have had to overhaul to make the updates not suddenly atrophy when I wanted to update them in a hurry, stuff like that - but, in general, it's stuff I'm expecting barfspace/bagtent to be able to address.

This is evolving into a quest under the [Barfspace Operations][] line.
