# Pitches and Scripts

This is an index page for various creative-writing-type pieces I write - spec scripts for TV shows, one-off loglines for sketches, stuff like that.

They're, you know, exercises.

I'm tracking quests for tending to the pieces I *really* like [here][psq].

## "Original" Work

I had this idea that's kind of like Ryan North's Machine of Death, but for time travel (and no, that's not How To Invent Everything) - it's a framing device for how to do stories about *competing modes of time travel*: [Timebag][] - it also has some fun thoughts on Canonicity and Inspiration such that should probably get their own notes, describing how a distributed writing project might be approached (especially in a bagtent-like model).

They'd live along the note about fanfiction described above.

There's also this *old* idea, way old, I tried to manifest here: [Glitchless][]

There's another weird little one-off novel concept I wrote a few lines for: [Rimraf][]

Oh, I've also had my long-running idea for a Movie To End All Movies, one that I've only really found the guts to lean into now that I've found Eris: [Aneris][]

There's also this thing that's based on the first dream I had that left me *shaken* when I woke up: [Luc Curios][]

## A whole other thing

This can be my jumping off point for merging in all my thoughts on [The Neighborhood][] (whether you're Networked or Not).

## Spec bits, riffs and shit

I started writing a bit for Silicon Valley based on a gag I started doing in the huttj Slack: [Venture Capitalist Optimization][]

I also thought it could be cool to have a little scene in Mr. Robot explaining why fsociety would have *encrypted* E Corp's data instead of just *destroying* it, which itself has larger implications for the nature of disrupting capitalism: [The Key][]

I've also had a thought about how the second half of Tomorrowland could have been written a lot better, and how there's a better production of that story, [just a dream away][].

Actually, it's a lot like this pitch I'd been working on for a while: [Let's Talk Tommy][]

An idea for another episode of Black Mirror: [Face to Faiths][]

There's this whole other spec that had emerged for me, for Atlanta: [Live Performances Nightly][]

I've also had this idea for how I'd want to approach a reboot of [Daredevil][].

That same kind of thought process led to [The Batfather][].

Speaking of DC, I've also thought of a [Martian-Manhunter-oriented Justice League][MM] pitch.

I've also had thoughts going *way* back, about how I'd continue [Angel][].

And, by this point, you can imagine I've got a thing or two to say about the concept of [fanfiction][].

At the end of the season where Dennis left It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I thought of a spec script for how I would address the question of his wanting to leave the past behind him, and the folly of doing so: [Mister Reynolds' Neighborhood][DENNIS]

## Legacy description from original repo

So, the other day in Slack, I made this joke about how this metaphor I just described would work well as a gag on Silicon Valley, and then Dan Hiester started talking about how that's how Ronald D. Moore got started as a writer for *Star Trek: The Next Generation*, and I've kind of been saving up bits and pieces of spec scripts for years under the assumption that nobody'd want to read them, and so...

I made this repo initially to collect the little bits and pieces of TV show scenes I come up with here and there, but then I realized I also had these ideas for *movies* and stuff that I'd been putting in their *own* bare repos, and I figured [I already have enough repos with just a summary and no content](https://github.com/stuartpb/collected-writings), so I decided to incorporate *them* into this repo as *well* by broadening the scope a bit. (Framing this as a repo for *pitches* as well as scripts makes it a little easier to explain what I'm going for with a script, so I don't have to worry about getting the whole script right to convey the high-level idea.)
