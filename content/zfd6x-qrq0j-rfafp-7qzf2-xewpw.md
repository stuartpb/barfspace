# threads with myself

these notes are often conversations, and lists let them be threaded

- by which I mean thesethese
  - like how they follow a train of thought
    - and are grouped into statements
      - and kind of nest like this in most formulations?
    - but can have "sibling comments" that go down another path
  - they're really easy to refactor
    - and to insert into when coming back later
      - even if you're just jumping around when initially creating / editing a file!
      - isn't that, ultimately, what replying is?
        - or, at least, that's how I structure my threads (and replies to others) on Twitter, and via email.
          - yeah, I post like at least three people at once. tcsh
  - and really easy to port
    - drop them into slides!
    - put them in a website blurb!

but yeah, they're like mailing lists and Reddit. And, you know, wiki talk pages (or the main content pages, if you're on TV Tropes, wokka wokka wokka)

## (keanu voice) whoa

- okay, deja vu saying that last part... have I had this thought before?
  - link to page on how sometimes it's faster to write to a new file than try to buffer and search for the incoming content?
    - that overlaps the file servers stuff I was thinking about
    - This is why mapping Tab to Indent (and Shift+Tab to reverse) for a line is so important
      - You can do this in VS Code, and I have (and I believe Shift+Tab is then mapped automatically, which is incredible)
      - but it's inspired by the tab functionality in OneNote
      - It's not just for code: it helps for semantic refactoring (ie. "this is more of a sibling than a child" etc)

## following up

[the earliest Bagtent history kernel](fyd6d-81rzj-g0892-971ke-k0dre) was described as a "talk page", and seems to be the only other instance of the phrase I could find by grep. so that's how far back, and where, the awareness goes - and how it tends to give me [The Ultimate Vertigo of Recursive Quiddity](7vrfz-hc1hv-1pbx4-0ahfb-eq1wr)
 as I try to describe my own style of description until I can see the insides of my own eyes
