# background on Stubarks

I love stuzzy, but I want a computer I can throw in pretty much any purse (or even my pocket).

I thought about trying to make one out of a Raspberry Pi, but after staring down the prospectibe costs for the parts for such an endeavor (a reasonably-sized screen, keyboard, etc), I figured there must be a cheaper pre-made thing.

Most of the "good Netbooks" I could find were just small Chromebooks, but I found *one* thing that had a 7-inch form factor and was still easily available: the RCA Voyager.

On top of everything, the Voyager has an Intel Atom processor, meaning that it's an x64 machine!

I found it on Amazon for $48, which is a little too close to $50 for me to feel like this is a justifiable purchase (considering how most of the reviews I found for it were like "this is so bad"). However, I was able to find it on Walmart.com for $35, which is much more in line with what I was looking for ("I bought this computer at Walmart" seems like the perfect origin for an *RCA computer* in 2020).

## observations upon unboxing

Oh wow, okay, so I was worried about needing to use the USB Micro port for accessories (ie. a pointing device) because it would impact my ability to charge the device, but it turns out that it comes with a separate AC adapter that uses a *barrel plug*.

It can charge from the Micro USB port, too, but the Quick-Start Guide says "Use ONLY the included AC Adapter to charge the battery". I'm guessing they probably meant "instead of other barrel plugs", but it sounds like they're discouraging the user from using USB to charge

The note below the diagram with that line reinforces that impression (sic, sentence emphasis mine - the words "round port" are underlined in the original):

> Charging time will vary depending on remaining battery life. Charging from 0%, should take approximately 4-5 hours. **Use ONLY the included AC adapter with the small _round port_.** You may not be able to turn on your tablet for at least 20 minutes if the battery was fully drained.

while reviewing [build and model numbers](xzchg-e0wee-42ahw-k69bg-k4z05), I realized that this could be because that's all they tested for FCC compliance with

It could also just be that the barrel plug is a lot more effective at powering the device - I've noticed that USB charging comes up as "charging slowly", though that might have been plugged into a PC

(the needing-to-charge-before-powering-on is like my least favorite downside of the Nintendo Switch but whatever)

## other details

Also, unsurprisingly, there are no sensors on the keyboard case, so closing the clamshell does nothing, you need to manually sleep the device. This is already how stuzzy works, so, again, that is perfect

It looks like I have to take it out of the case to change the MicroSD card? Sweet, that makes it *even more* like internal storages (and weird like the Switch)
