# Empty repos

All of these are under https://github.com/stuartpb and are mostly serving as placeholders for projects I have in mind (they have nothing but the repo description in a README and maybe a license, and maybe some issues that I'll note her should merge in)

I should write about them a little more in my notes, and check if I have C9 content to push

- gitsuba
- strikelist.org
- binder
  - 7 issues to copy in
- one-with-everything
- millwork.jscad
- ballotine
  - I'll just delete this and maybe someday I'll bring back the paragraph or whatever I had on an internal wiki about it
- what.stuartpb.com
  - I should date this, note it around how-i-roll's tomb, and then delete the repo, as it's completely superseded by these notes.
- triviaglobe
- timewaiter
- pngico.js
  - I think this was going to be based on a Microsoft Cursor Format library
- docker-opencv-utils
  - this has probably gotten better in the last 4 years
- snoosnoo
  - I think this started in the issues for another JS reddit client
  - Interfacing with Reddit was really bad when I originally started this repo, not sure if it's gotten better
- raddons
  - this is probably redundant and dumb today
- trouter
  - someone took this name, and I still haven't figured out exactly what I was going for with this
- path-to-glob
  - same deal (in that I don't quite remember what I was going for)
- acebins
- steamshu
- textables
  - I feel like this already exists?
- whatisthis
- presentrello
  - I've got a note somewhere that this exists now
- itself.co
- stuartup.com (oof)
- fromhats
  - this would be great with Blockly
  - there's also that library I made that permutes
- hugs

## ones I'm pretty sure I have something to push but didn't

- shell-split
- vils
- onesshot
- silins-fulcrum
- strewthbrat (kind of? I could maybe recap this, but it was because someone was telling me they'd "pay for" a "framework" and I was trying to explain how dumb that was)
- reticulata
- elval
- wjet
- flowsnake.js

## other

- dinsdale
  - this has pretty much evolved into BISNES/BIGDOG
  - the issues here are maybe integrable into the repo
  - after doing that, I think this repo should be deleted
- peoplearedead
  - This bot was applicable once, and kind of a bummer.
  - I think I'll stash a note about it somewhere and  then delete the page.
- I started doing this at a Sears hackathon, I stopped because they kicked up out after like two hours and tl;dr: fuck sears, throttled to death by its own Randian bullshit
- phrome
  - the Browser API Polyfill makes this *completely* redundant

## very empty repos

heh, I created a blog.stuartpb.com repo on Sep 27, 2014. Four years too early, and the wrong form factor (anyway I didn't even initialize the repo, so I'm gonna go ahead and delete this)
