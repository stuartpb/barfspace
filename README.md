These are my notes.

They're public, because I don't really care who reads them. I don't expect anybody to, because they're a mess.

If you do try reading them, realize that they're intended primarily for myself, and any readability to outsiders is a mere byproduct of me trying to make them clear enough for me to recognize in the far future.
