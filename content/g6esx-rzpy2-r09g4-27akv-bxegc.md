# Special offer for Zillow employees

They don't have to tell me if they work for Zillow. I'll let them deny it. I'm not a Nazi, and as thirsty as I am for revenge, it was a thing at a bar, it's not like I need to start a new branch of Mossad over it.

If you admit you work for Zillow, I cannot let you pay full price for your tickets. You can play half the cost of a ticket. OR you can pay double. Either one works for me - the question is what works for you, because you don't get to just pay the normal amount.

I offer the discount because, based on my *personal fucking experience with them*

Not free tickets, because they don't deserve them. These Zillow fucks get enough free fucking entertainment they don't appreciate. This is only for the ones who are willing to give up even a *token* sum of their ill-begotten fortunes to Because, based on the reactions I saw from them at Hula Hula, THEY NEED TO SEE THIS ACT MORE THAN ANYBODY.

Like I said, this is a scary act. It might give you nightmares. For some of you, it might give you the first *true* nightmare you've had in your lives.

**Good.**

I want to live in a world where everybody has had at least one. Where you can call in sick to work telling your boss you had a really bad nightmare, and they *understand*.
