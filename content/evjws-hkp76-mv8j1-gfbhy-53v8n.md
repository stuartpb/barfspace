# political scrawl from some point

in the cost breakdown for making a thing where you're including value for the time, labor and energy of the people who made it, "profit" is basically the line item for "fuck you"

reading about [mutualism][], specifically critique of it, I'm seeing this concept of "labor vouchers", and, like, it kind of boils down to Whuffie for me. We shouldn't deny anybody food or healthcare so there's that function of money cut down, so if other things are predicated on a pledge based on reputation, why not have a system of hierarchically-recognized self-reported time spent on labor connected with its material products? that seems like the closest thing to how functional societies delegate scarce resources that I've seen

speaking of Whuffie, Cory doctorow had an essay on why it sucks, should make sure I've got a link somewhere around here
