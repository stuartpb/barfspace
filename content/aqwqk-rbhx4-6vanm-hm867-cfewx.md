# Browser Extensions

These are in the process of being ported to the [WebExtension API](6gt9v-wmqpg-5n8vx-6ke1b-227m6):

- [NilPass](frbht-aas1n-jp9rb-m0spq-f23mj)
- The one that takes specimen snapshots of pages and posts them to Gist
  - Previously the OPWS Surveyor, but most of the planned features for that extension will be rolled into NilPass
- KeyboardLeopard I guess
- Hey wouldn't it be cool if I brought back Clipsnail?
- Rejig would maybe be applicable for Firefox as an alternative to re-running webext

## Tab-and-window-related projects

These would all be applicable one level up in a [Windowsystem Metabrowser](41v84-ycwdn-4p91p-4xt5f-kn96k)

- [Tabalanche](3ex5c-s1wt7-s290e-zx6q3-88jp0)
- [Scrollbar Bookmarks](c27g5-kdtm1-26ar9-t6kdc-5mb4e)
