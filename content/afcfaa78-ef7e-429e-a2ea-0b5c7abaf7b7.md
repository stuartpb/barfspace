# Here's the News with Me

Here's my page where I put little momentary thoughts. Sometimes, it's because I feel like it's just a *mood* I have to write about: other times, it's because I can't spare the energy to figure out how I want to work my thoughts into the morass of existing notes, and it'd be more efficient to just throw them on a little island and work backwards later.

For more about figuring out what was going on with me at any given point in time, check out the [Right Now][] index.

## News about the notes

This has sort of become the focus of my news updates here lately, just describing what I'm up to on the project of updating these notes.
