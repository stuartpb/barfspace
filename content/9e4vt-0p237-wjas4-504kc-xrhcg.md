https://www.pishop.us/product/raspberry-pi-zero-w/ is the simplest way to get a Pi 0 W

went ahead and got one, plus a WH because it looks like headers will be the simplest way to do this

## screen

https://www.dfrobot.com/product-1866.html?search=e%20ink&description=true also sounds cool? but I'll stick with the upstream hardware

## battery

[cool benchmarks](https://pwnagotchi.ai/installation/#sd-card)

considering a [PiSugar from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RC649ZC/)

the [suggested UPS-Lite](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32954180664.html) also sounds nice

the Pi Shop where I'm sourcing the Pi from has [Tiny-UPS](https://www.pishop.us/product/tiny-ups-worlds-tiniest-ups-with-gpio-indicator/), which I'd probably add to cart if there weren't 0 mention of it in the pgotchi docs because I don't feel like fucking with this, at all

I'll just use my Powermat banks for now tho

I might also look into cannibalizing [these stupid-cheap power banks via Mediocre](https://morningsave.com/deals/3-pack-buqu-nade-3350mah-grenade-power-bank-with-caribiner)

## real time clock

[throwing this in my cart](https://www.pishop.us/product/ds1307-rtc-board-real-time-clock-module-for-raspberry-pi/) because for $4 fuck it why not

was curious about the difference between this and the other one, googling "ds3231 vs ds1307" turned up [a simple answer](https://opensprinkler.com/forums/topic/hardware-change-ds1307-instead-ds3231/#post-38129) without even needing to click through (the more expensive one is bigger yet more accurate, if that were a priority)
