# FLOC Estimation

Figues in Lines of Code (also known as Fermi-Line-of-Code) Estimation is a way of measuring how much effort will be involved in implementing a feature or fix. It is based on [Fermi Estimation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem), and puts a neat easily-communicated metric of estimated effort on communicating milestones.

I originally had this idea on Sep 27, 2015, while developing Tabalanche. I hear Agile folks call it "T-shirt sizing", and don't use the explicit "approximate size of the code change in number of digits of the lines of code" scale.

(Trivia: I briefly called it "exloc", as in "exponent of ten". I realized that FLOC rolls off the tongue a lot better about five hours later.)
