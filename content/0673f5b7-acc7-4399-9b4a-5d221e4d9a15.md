# The Bellarian Award for Worst Person Ever

I don't wish to Curse this Holy Text with the names of most of the residents of the Darkest Pots of Thud, but I will speak of Its ruler.

The dark, twisted, bizarre, horrible being at the dead, lifeless center of the land of Thud is a demonic creature by the unholy name of [Doctor Henry Kissinger][Magic Murder Bag].

Throughout the dark and mysterious ancient age that was the recent American past, you will find more horror, more atrocity, more deserved bile and vitriol, more American piss and vinegar towards The Mad Doctor than any other Demon of Chaos, whether His name be Beelzebub, Lucifer, Satan, Krampus, The Literal Fucking Devil, Ba'al, Belial, the Fallen, or a bunch of *real* people who killed *Americans*.

Henry Kissinger is the one thing that lies in direct opposition to the Spirit of Bell: Someone unfunny, someone lazy, someone who is widely and correctly regarded as the most monstrous person in the history of humanity (and someone who would be arrested as a war criminal, if he ever had the *les testicules* to set foot in France again).

And they gave him a fucking Nobel Peace Prize for it.

Kissinger, and his Great Satanic vice, the lie of *realpolitik*, served to legitimize the worldview that all is but Order, that there is no Chaos, and that Discord is merely an illusion.

He is, truly, the world's biggest pile of shit, and that's why [so many people are counting the days until his death][byekissinger].

And, when that day comes, the True Devil will have truly left the Earth. And the dawning of the true Age of Aquarius shall begin (and I'm not talking about the part where the water will rise up to reclaim us all).
