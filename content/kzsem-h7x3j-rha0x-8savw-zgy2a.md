# Best Practices for Markdown Footlinks

Footlinks are those links you write by `[Putting a title on the left][and symbol on the right]` in the text, with `[and symbol on the right]: the-actual-target.md` on a separate line.

These were originally common in my notes, for all the reasons outlined in [this note](h3jma-ap4ef-01a3j-hfdjq-d31jq),

They're still applicable (up to the "Historical conventions" header), but only in authoring situations where you choose to use them, which you likely wouldn't, as [Inlining links](mkj61-12ak7-rea82-ks9qe-dqwer) is much more common now.

## Historical conventions

These are no longer relevant, but kept around for historical interest (ie. they could be reconsidered in some different way that addresses their shortcomings in the future):
