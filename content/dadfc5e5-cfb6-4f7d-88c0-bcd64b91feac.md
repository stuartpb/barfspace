# The Plan Plan

The content here has drifted around a ton: this was originally a growth that spontaneously developed on [My Old Bad Ideas][], that then moved on to [Get Your Shit Together][GYST]).

There were some quests that were here at one point which have since been migrated over to [Barfspace Operations][] - there's also the [Department of Development][DoD].

In the past, this page served as the central nexus for those things that have been consolidated at those locations (at which point it was known as "Project Akira", for its grotesque sprawl and encompassment): this page is now the centerpoint for musing on the relationship between all my Project and Activity notes (the first section of the [current root note][]).

We're taking stuff from those quests that wasn't really directive and moving it back to this page.

I'm gonna stick a line right here about how also we're trying to integrate [the existing history infrastructure of the project][history], which kind of recurses into the notion of explaining the current state of the notes - a thing that is kind of covered by [Get Your Shit Together][GYST] right now, I guess.

## A little thing about Quests vs. News vs. Right Now

So the thing is that News was, and/or is, meant to be like "snapshots of my life right now" - highlighting the cross-section of all my projects... Right Now was originally supposed to be a rotating overview of what's on my plate at the moment, but it's becoming obvious that it'd work a lot better as an index for something like a constant State of the Union for all my projects, with the index being the concise snapshot, maybe.

Anyway, there's also a matter of General Notes for Projects, and Quests (which often don't slice evenly to projects) to boot.

So I'm thinking what might make sense would be to merge Right Now with Project Ideas, Project Ideas maybe turning into a page or two like "Just Idle Thoughts and Planning" -

oh snap, Right Now is just Stage 1 and 2, where Ideas was Stages 0 and 1, in Unusual Studio terms. So maybe that's the solution?

Nah, I think what it is is... I should have a Projects index with just, you know, everything as a big list with "all the pages for each project, if there's no dedicated index page for it", something like that, where they're really pretty much just in order of how hairy the notes situation is?

No, wait, they can be organized in terms of stage (and then hairiness, maybe, IDK). Anyway, Right Now would then be a recency-list index

One axis I feel like I kind of need to slice along is "projects that are inherently personal" (ie. "fix the left joycon to stop drifting on my Switch" versus, like, NilPass), and I think that was the original intention behind Right Now, to reflect my personal priorities in a way that a Projects list couldn't. Right Now was meant for the personal - but not *too* personal? because that's what News was kind of about.

Okay, so, that's kind of served by Quests, really. My "current personal state" is best reflected as a recap of what's to be done, personally.

So maybe Right Now... yeah I think Right Now just needs to become, like, Quest Tracker, with the Quests page being the overview tree of all Quests.

and I mean that does reflect its origins as a Planfile

and then Project Ideas can become the "random aimless musings" connector to that, where what we're currently calling "News" becomes "where I put random aimless musings when they're not clearly attached to a project".

## An excised musing about organic growth and the nature of thinking versus creation

There was a task in "Dividing Up the New World" in the [Barfspace Operations][] for "Write somewhere (in the neighborhood of [metaquiddity][] or [the meta collection][]) about how it's totally natural for more layers of indirection to organically emerge like this"

There was a subtask beneath that: Shout out to the tree down by the "Everything I Know" or whatever quest in the [Mindfulness Arc][], which is doing this same sort of layer-forming

The rest were listed as checkbox items beneath that:

Like, ultimately, this is part of my overall intent with the Meta Collection to capture my meditations on writing in this repo, and how they echo out in the world around me

Should loop in that one XKCD somewhere around here about [an entire system just existing to maintain itself][xkcd 1579], because I know that's definitely a mania thing I take care to avoid

[xkcd 1579]: https://xkcd.com/1579/

There's also the thing about how this is all kind of like a rough draft and how, with programming / creative projects, notes like this as a to-do list, if you return to them a ton, so long as you're only focusing on things you currently can do and sub-dividing what you can currently do, you can eventually get to a point where you've effectively accomplished your entire task in the form of specifying out its entire structure (or that a bunch of the chains will collapse into completion after a very small number of nontrivial tasks complete and all the effectively-Promise.all()-like-waits close with the parent checks getting checked off by their lists being completed)

Another meta idea I'm gonna drop right here right now: how, like, all this fanciness I'm doing for hashes is only really necessary for humans under the assumption that we need an adversarial model for authoritative / canonical names like IPNS, and how just searching for a thing and picking the most popular result, like, no kidding Google legitimately changed the world, and now just googling eight words from a John Mulaney act is enough to find you the full transcript within five seconds

## Notes for the top-level README

I *think* these are all present? There should probably be a page that can link off from the Root Note talking about the design of the README / landing page

- You are not expected to understand these, they are primarily just public to make it so it's as hard for me to lose my notes as possible
- That you might be able to read them is a useful benefit that I may inconsistently cater to at times
- When I'm trying to make them accessible, it's as much about making it so I don't forget myself when I come back and try to read them later, if not more, than about making them accessible to others
- They're like code comments like that
- These are a constantly-updating set of documents, unless stated otherwise
- Feel free to get your own ideas from these notes, but don't go attributing anything more than the words to me
- At the end: "With all these disclaimers out of the way, Click here to proceed to the current root note."
