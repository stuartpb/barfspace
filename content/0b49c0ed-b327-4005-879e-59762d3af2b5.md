## Slightly improved Raspberry Pi spacer

I should upload the stuff for the two-pin-based spacer I made for my printer's Pi.

I could list other improvements I might like around the plastic around this later, too (like maybe enough space in the door for your fingers to pull the chip out easily?)

## Drybox stuff

I have [an idea for building a runout meter for dryboxes](05efe4bb-ff2a-4abb-82b0-66cbf125d485.md)

## Build Plate Blues

- [x] Buy a powder-coated build plate from Prusa.
  - [x] Also order a new PEI sheet so you can remove both sides of this sheet when the time comes.

## The Nozzle Collector

- [ ] Consider getting a hardened nozzle from [E3D][] or [Micro-Swiss][].
  - Amazon's prices are cheaper than Prusa here.
- [ ] Tool up for nozzle changing.
  - [ ] [This][nozkit] kit comes with some, *plus* some nozzle sizes that Prusa doesn't ship settings for.
- [ ] Print something to hold your nozzles between changes.
  - I was thinking something like individual nozzle slots on the top of the frame when not in use - these kits store a *lot* of nozzles? Like you wear out nozzles enough to keep three of each size on hand? w/e

- [ ] Should you maybe get a new 0.4 brass nozzle to replace your current one, in case abrasive filament's worn it out?
  - Prusa beats [this price][Amazonozzle] (they chage $7.11 for a 0.4mm nozzle), so this might be a thing to order if you get more Prusa shipping.

https://help.prusa3d.com/article/fJa7GxLSG6-changing-or-replacing-nozzle is the official manual page for it on the MK3S extruder.

You might also want to get some [cleaning filament](https://www.amazon.com/Monoprice-Premium-Printer-Filament-1-75MM/dp/B016QUH514/).

## One Less Resistor in the Circuit

You've been paying Amazon retailers for filament of unknown provenance for too long. Pretty soon, you'll have paid the entire cost of what one of these machines would have cost to buy (if you haven't already): for that, you probably could have extruded it yourself for a third of the cost. (It'd probably be for the best to not try doing the math on that until you can safely put those days behind you.)

Completing this quest will unlock Fully Reliably Reproducable Print Recipes, where the entire construction of a print, from chemical form to extrusion, is fully documented, and can be altered independently.

It will also unlock full material and color control, including reuse of recycled material as a component.

It will also unlock significantly cheaper filament on demand.

- [ ] Get a Filastruder Kit.

## Multi-Material Upgrade

Remember when you bought that whole goofy Replicator 2X clone because you wanted to be able to print multiple materials? And then it turned out that dual extrusion is a massive headache to work with? And then you bought this MK3 because this seemed a lot more like how you were thinking you'd expect multi-material to work, and you were getting all these different kinds of material that you'd like to swap more readily between anyway, and yeah your printer's really incomplete without this.

- [x] Get the Multi-Material Upgrade Kit

## Sharpiecore

There's a recipe for [using Sharpies to color filament](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:312327) on Thingiverse, but you can think of some enhancements that would make this better...

Completing this quest will unlock Sharpie Print Colors.

- [ ] Thread some PLA through a cored Sharpie.

## Retooling

There are some cool tutorials about how you can rework your Prusa as a plotter or laser cutter. Maybe you could do something like that...

Completing this quest will potentially unlock 2D Plotting, 2D Cutting, and Laser Etching.

- [ ] Redesign the Prusa's X carriage to more easily detach from the extruder assembly.
- [ ] Redesign the Prusa fan bracket to clip into the extruder assembly without screws.

Thinking about how you'd do this:

- The only connected piece you *really* need to keep on this for other tools is the PINDA
- Taking the rest of the extruder off so something could go right where the nozzle goes wiould be cool.
- It'd be nice to be able to swap the extruder axis motor onto other parts (ie so it can be used to rotate a calligraphy pen) - this'd probably be an easy one to convert into a connection-stays-put with a port on the end.
- The filament sensor seems less like something that'd be so reusable in other contexts, but a generic "here's a few data lines" port next to the Extruder connection (and the filament sensor lines living in the same bundle with the Extruder and the PINDA) would be cool
- Same goes for the fans: you'd have two more port connections for DC motors. (Could one of these be hijacked for a laser? Does the Extruder line get that? Does it have to use the same power source as the Hotend did?)
- The connection to the hotend... looks kinda delicate - this might need to become a kind of connector swap at the motherboard (and, like, a side connection)

## The Little Dimmer

Your printer's backlight was too bright, so you fixed it by introducing a trimpot to the LED circuit - but isn't there a better way?

- [x] Order a new RepRap Discount board and a bag of sockets.
- [x] Fix the RRD board to work with your Prusa by flipping the pin housings.
- [x] Test that fix by running a print or two with the board.
- [x] Cut the trace to the backlight.
- [x] Epoxy a socket to bridge the connection through a custom circuit.
- [x] Solder the socket.
- [x] Place a trimpot in the socket.
- [x] Print new parts for your modified board in translucent PETG.
- [ ] Make a refined version of the dimmer circuit that's more sophisticated than a trimpot just sitting awkwardly in a socket on the board.
  - [ ] Complete the "A Little Jig" and/or "Better Than a Breadboard" quests to unlock the techniques necessary to run the circuit off a small ESP8266 (so it can be IOT-controlled).
  - [ ] Progress on the "Conductivity" quest to open up a 3D Printed Linear Trimpot as a potential design option.
  - [ ] Remember that you can do both: an ESP that reads the trimpot for the PWM value it spits to the LED, unless a REST command overrides it, in which case the solution is to jank the slider to "wake" manual control back
  - Honestly, the more time I've spent with this, the more I'm satisfied with just the mod that I originally got this idea from: a switch with full-brightness, half-brightness, and off.
- [ ] Make a writeup for this.

I've been noticing that it seems like my SD card malfunctions around when I try changing the brightness: is there maybe a capacitor I can put on this that eases the fluctuations of the brightness change?

## A New Stack

Pshh. This 3D print software isn't so impressive. You could do all that, easy.

Completing this quest will potentially unlock all sorts of inventive new 3D print features, specifically around having print jobs execute from SD directly from your slicer (which could be web-based).

- [ ] Look at the Slic3r codebase to see how hard it'd be to port to JS.
- [ ] Complete the "Refactoring Plushu" quest to have a decent basis for an OctoPrint replacement.

## Completed Upgrades

- Extruder upgraded from MK3 to MK3S.
- Dimmer circuit added to LCD backlight.
- Custom faceplate with arm with cutout for adjustment trimpot on standard RepRapDiscount controllers, as well as a slot for the Brightness adjuster (which should really just be replaced with a switch, I think I wrote that somewhere)

## Keep Your Feet On

https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2765399/files if I felt like it, and, honestly, considering how rarely I move my Prusa... I'm kind of fine with it as-is, these feet seem like they'd be adding a headache to disassembly without providing a major benefit

these might be more important now that I have it on a wire shelf though
