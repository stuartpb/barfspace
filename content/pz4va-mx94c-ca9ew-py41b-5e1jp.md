# Bagtent Browser Note Hub

This page aggregates everything around a good UI for browsing / editing [bagtent](q80bh-jwx0p-rfbtm-09j3w-2vnr3).

The notes on that page are important, and might even make sense for some of those to be integrated into the view from this vantage.

Actually, going through now... I think what's really needed right now is an index collecting this whole aspect of Bagtent.

## Meta thought

This should be dragged to the Oozy Sewer, but these subpages are being merged in when they were only ever one heading/section long, and cherry-picked from when they're longer

## Note

I'm realizing this page was separate from that page because I *meant to have CLI tooling notes*.

Most of this content should be kicked back to there (being rich-UI-oriented), and then this can link there, and link to another page focusing on CLI tools - and aggregate concepts that are legitimately shared between them. (And some things are shared between just the Rich UI stuff and outside concerns, like Git / the notestack!)

## Navigation notes

This is the stuff that used to be on [this page](qw1p9-7vq47-cnayb-nzx01-vz6ca) (or should have been?)

- [Tabbing Concept from a OneNote State of Mind](bkbsz-bpx6j-as9kr-4k3ms-96emp)
- [thoughts on a renderer](9tx7h-9hxjp-mham1-d3125-fft4g)
  - I believe there's some stuff on breadcrumb navigation to be pulled out here
- [Horus, the Tree Navigation UI for Bagtent](gxwgq-215gn-40947-n0vv1-r8tr4)
- [Borkflowy, the Bagtent Accordion concept](n3ht7-s55td-078sn-zx3ny-z0b0q)
- [This Bagtent Publisher concept](gmq14-az5nx-wa9kj-9hm78-1t24g)
- [Incorporating Git Metadata](ag6jz-sx4hn-p08xd-fmmh5-zxw8g)
- [Metadata Database Design](pqjhc-jw5dw-0za66-1xx15-7br0r)

## Editing tool considerations

- [bagtent editor ideas](w744d-0ekjn-8k83g-937xd-vbez3)

## Command-line tools

I'm actually not sure where to put notes on the Bagtent CLI tools? anyway, for now I'm putting them here:

- [Profiling and parallelizing Node scripts](76kaf-n67bs-vxayb-s85yv-j0pms)
