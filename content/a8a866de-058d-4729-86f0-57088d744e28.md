# "Original" Premises

I had this idea that's kind of like Ryan North's Machine of Death, but for time travel (and no, that's not How To Invent Everything) - it's a framing device for how to do stories about *competing modes of time travel*: [Timebag](f3100c35-825d-404c-83e2-6c29352d386e.md)

it also has some fun thoughts on Canonicity and Inspiration such that should probably get their own notes, describing how a distributed writing project might be approached (especially in a bagtent-like model). They'd live along [this note about fanfiction](bd72f20b-397c-4908-9112-1a86e073c492.md) that's on [the "Derivative" work page](bf409581-d752-437a-a086-60002a0f6889.md)

There's also this *old* idea, way old, I tried to manifest here: [Glitchless](0b6986e0-bcb8-4a8d-95d4-f7f97e3d56fd.md)

There's another weird little one-off novel concept I wrote a few lines for: [Rimraf](de7a26b8-e3a8-4316-9044-224b4c840b40.md)

Oh, I've also had my long-running idea for a Movie To End All Movies, one that I've only really found the guts to lean into now that I've found Eris: [Aneris](5760dde5-514b-40d5-88c2-0dbedfc65041.md)

There's also this thing that's based on the first dream I had that left me *shaken* when I woke up: [Luc Curios](9af6adc9-f53e-42a1-9e72-b5dcc9353891.md)
