# Lingering post-Project-Akira tasks

- [ ] Update https://github.com/stuartpb/collected-writings
- [ ] Spin down the Lean Notes brand? At this point, the org has no repos: I honestly might as well just delete it, archive the lean-notes repo (noting in the repo description that it was merged here), and redirect leannotes.com to stuartpb.com
- [ ] Actually start moving the Trello stuff to Lean Notes pages
- [ ] Write up an explanation of what the hell is going on
- [ ] Figure out what barf.space should have on it now.
  - [ ] How about a stub repo on GitHub?
    - the README can tell the story of Project Barfspace, and how it turned into my notes
    - it can then link to [the old barfspace readme node][OBRN], which is now the hub for a few pages that point toward what Barfspace is meant to embody within those notes
- [ ] Figure out what to do with all these lingering references to "barfspace" around.
  - [ ] They can probably turn into links to that old readme node, which has links to stuff like the name explainer page and [Project Akira][] that might make it clearer (or muddier, whatever).
