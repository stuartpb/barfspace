# Day 1 with Stubarks

Just wrote up [the background on this device](030770d8-f787-4318-890c-a21e45e553cd.md)

## first steps

I did a phone setup that I had to do again anyway after unlocking the bootloader - see "setup part 2" on [the next page](c71d9572-1931-4d46-ab1c-7577c6c577f4.md) for a basic recap

## Guides

I already had a bunch of pages open on stuzzy planning to reflash this device before I bought it, so I'm gonna go ahead and dive into Tabalanche to retrieve some of those:

- [Porting PostmarketOS to a new device](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device), and
- [This XDA thread for unlocking the bootloader](https://forum.xda-developers.com/general/general/guide-rca-voyager-rct6873w42-unlock-t3582973)

That XDA thread also describes how to "root" the Android installation, but I didn't buy this so I could have another Android device - I bought it so I could have another *Linux box*.

I've downloaded that script, but I'm gonna go through the Postmarket wiki page first...

## From the top: installing pmbootstrap

Proceeding on stuzzy (as noted above)

I see there is a [pmbootstrap package on AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/pmbootstrap/), but it notes that [this issue](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/383) entails a command line flag I don't feel like messing with (to deal with a missing `aports`? there's no AUR package for it, so apparently this isn't a situation like Nix where people make packages for it in parallel distros), so I'm gonna take the tack recommended in the wiki and run `pip3 install --user pmbootstrap`

(aside, from a side-journey looking for an aports AUR package: https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/wiki/Creating_an_Alpine_package is neat)

running `pmbootstrap init` and choosing the default work directory

for vendor, typing 'rca' and starting a new port

Entering `voyager` as the code name. Even though [this list](https://github.com/jaredrummler/AndroidDeviceNames/blob/master/json/manufacturers/RCA.json) uses the model number as the "codename", the convention for Postmarket seems to be more about device distinction, and I don't feel like remembering the whole model number right now. Maybe someday if RCA really does release another device they call "Voyager" I'll go back and redo it with the model number

pretty sure it's x86_64 with an Intel Atom chip...

Let me go ahead and check it. https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/How_to_find_device-specific_information#Device_Architecture says to try `adb shell`...

## stuzzy Android dev setup

but this is what happens when I try to run stuff like that:

```
error: insufficient permissions for device
See [http://developer.android.com/tools/device.html] for more information
```

Looking at `lsusb`, it looks like this is my device:

```
Bus 002 Device 006: ID 0e8d:201c MediaTek Inc.
```

https://github.com/M0Rf30/android-udev-rules/blob/master/51-android.rules does list a generic rule for MTK, so I'm going to go ahead and follow https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Android_Debug_Bridge#Adding_udev_Rules

```
yay -S android-udev
sudo usermod -aG adbusers stuart
sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
```

Now, of course, I need to log out and back in (pain in the ass...)

I try doing a `yay -Syu` (since I'm going to have to kill sessions and log out anyway, I might as well take care of anytihng needing a reboot at once), but [all downloads are too slow at the moment](ac8aa2a8-01de-44b6-ab42-08e9a5b19702.md)

## anyway, getting the device to work

went through a whole bunch of herping and derping before I realized udev wouldn't process the rule until I unplugged the device and plugged it back in

That made it so I could get the prompt when running `adb shell`, we're back in business

## getting back to it

restarting `pmbootstrap init`

running `uname -m` in `adb shell` tells me this is actually an `armv7` device. Ah well, that's actually kind of what I expected (especially after seeing the MediaTek USB identifier), and a little bit what I actually wanted, too. (hopefully that'll have better battery life? maybe sometime I can see if I can find the Atom version)

Now that I've looked into it a little more, I'm going with the codename `voyager-mtk` (to distinguish from `voyager-intel`, if I ever find it)

Actually, make that `voyager-pro-mtk`, in light of the keyboard question I'm gonna make a separate profile for this SKU

saying it *does* have a keyboard and storage

## getting the boot.img for analysis

Following https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Using_prebuilt_kernels

```
ls -l /dev/block/platform/
ls -l /dev/block/platform/soc/11120000.mmc/by-name
```

I see `lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 20 2020-03-11 17:13 boot -> /dev/block/mmcblk0p9`

Ah... and now we need root, and `adbd cannot run as root in production builds`

Looks like it's time to bust out that XDA link

Going into settings on the device and setting "OEM unlocking" on

## things start to go off the rails
