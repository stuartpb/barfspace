- [Opinion: We Built A Broken Internet. Now We Need To Burn It To The Ground.](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/mikemonteiro/we-built-a-broken-internet-now-we-need-to-burn-it) Basically a Thomas Friedman article about the need to replace Twitter with Mastodon. A white guy taking the observation everybody on Twitter has been making for years (the site sucks because it was made by white guys, for white guys) and tries to pass it off as his own bold call to action. No real suggestions for *how* we might do that, though. He's an *ideas* guy, you see.
- [I am not always very attached to being alive](https://theoutline.com/post/7267/living-with-passive-suicidal-ideation), a great article about living with suicidal ideation
- [The Woman Who Rewrote Me](https://electricliterature.com/the-woman-who-tried-to-rewrite-me/) (note: article is about a deeply abusive relationship)
- [The Curse of the Diaeresis](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-curse-of-the-diaeresis), or, Why The New Yorker Will Never Stop Doing That Pretentious Thing With the Dots
