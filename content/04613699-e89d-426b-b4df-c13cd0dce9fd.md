# Worker Space Provisioning Simulator (Mini/meta)Game

A puzzle game where you have to zone a room efficiently enough to survive a wave and proceed to the next level

Could also have this as a "grinding efficiency" system, which ties into some of the ideas I have with [Chao Garden redux](13e3c6d4-02b8-4c57-84b7-c7e1f3a10f3b.md)
