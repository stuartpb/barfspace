# Lean Notes Principles and Style

[tiling background image](https://d2k1ftgv7pobq7.cloudfront.net/images/backgrounds/wave.png)

I've taken the lists from this Meta board and made separate pages for each of them:

- [Tenets](4ye6g-r9qjd-v99ew-10vqj-2qbwg)
- [What Lean Notes is not](yr20x-gbxk8-wk8yp-4956z-yygcv)
- [Anti-techniques](ct737-rhhh9-yw85m-15179-4q0vh)
- [Style](bqz8s-hwcy5-8pay1-1zgs5-fq04c)

[this page on Emergent Patterns in Lean Notes](4rc6p-dg83n-pga6v-64kt1-22hv6) was originally from another board, but it makes more sense here going forward.

The first list on the board was just "Taglines", listing "Notes on a Startup Project" and "Zero to Software" as various brainstorming alternate titles.

I've ended up going with the latter to rescope Lean Notes' old content, even though I fucked up and didn't buy the domain when I had the idea (causing someone else to use it a few years later)
