# Markdown-First Kubernetes Notebook Literate Monster Blob

Or just a dynamic templating system strong enough to supplant that compoent of Helm, as well as be appropriate enoutgh to extend down into specifying dynamic / custom-element frontend templates. Microservice defintions are modeled as "simple enough" (just a file that defines a container image to add, like, one script to)

This covers a lot of ideas I had before bed the night of June 5, 2020

- [Adventure Formatting](13acdf3d-bcbb-495c-aa0e-4d6abf08ada2.md)
  - turns into an exploration of generalized document-to-HTML mapping using "only frontmatter"
  - you can even think of a document as defining a "route", which returns the content of the static page
    - and that would be implied by some kind of base template establishing this
      - like "all Markdown files should be interpreted as the response to a GET by default"
- [Literate File Creation](ebf8bbe1-88e4-47cb-ab8e-30659bedd974.md)
- [Literate Tool Definition](55545b12-8f8f-4832-b48a-4207e63e5815.md)
- [generalizing a view of dynamic templates](2178b3f3-d741-4a13-9c66-4c661095adf8.md)
  - this comes closest to describing a runtime model and the Windowsystem Metabrowser
  - [Lost in the Weeds](c2fbe19c-953e-4b89-9d37-9081666cd6fc.md)
    - this kind of reiterates the "Literat File Creation" idea
