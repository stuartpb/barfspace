# Water pouch projects

Stuff I'm not into at the moment:

## Bite Valve cover

> I lost the mouthpiece and cap for my water pouch. I've got new mouthpieces, but I still need to come up with a good rigid piece to cover the bite valve when I'm not using it.
>
> After some experimentation with geometry, my new plan is to have a "collar" around the mouthpiece (maybe even designed to fit best up near the top, so that can keep it oriented), and a cap with a retainer ring holding the rest of the neck to keep it in place (the cap would have lips at the top and bottom to fit over the collar)

my Source valve is better anyway

## Crank the Pump

> It's a pain in the ass to take your hydration pouch out of your vest just to toss a glass of water in, not to mention looking conspicuous as hell. What'd be nice would be if you had some sort of mechanism, one you could swap out for the mouthpiece, to siphon water directly from a source and put it into your pouch (or vice versa)...

again, I have a Source part for this now. It doesn't let me pump siphon, but it lets me drain bottles and pour from cups, and that's enough
