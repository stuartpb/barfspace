This is a concept node, so the text below should be split off into smaller thought pages.

## Iterations / Incarnations

- [oldest iteration](27z7n-f4d5h-598f1-84z57-f0ecc)
  - this was more when I was thinking I would invent my own IDE implementation
    - like, "with an option to use c9 instead if you need something the core IDE isn't good at"
  - Theia and code-server were not even remotely on the radar
    - remote servers and virtual machines were, though
- [First Agnostic](tjmtj-rx6fh-gwabs-e5vkj-3ws61)
  - I'd say this is sort of where my vision is centered, ultimately?
    - However, "Workspace Pod Manager" is in a scope I can feasibly intend to operate within at the moment
    - Ultimately, I think this serves as a kind of "end goal"
      - like, models in the Workspace Manager iteration ought to be designed to not conflict with it
  - [Windowsystem/"Frame" Splitting Model](mzjfd-q9wp4-wra3t-nzrnc-0k3w7)
    - sort of a dying gasp of interoperability with the "make my own IDE" conceptualization
  - [lost thought on connecting frontend to backend](mwvj1-g9sby-0waxm-40m7s-t4kcn)
- [Workspace Pod Manager for Kubernetes](64g19-6195p-93apg-pnxte-2tpg8)
