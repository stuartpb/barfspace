"Who's Rachel?"f

"That? It says 'rache'. German for 'revenge'."

"Well, I was thinking, because it looks like it was written on a cum stain."

"Oh, I'm pretty sure it *is* a cum stain."

"Oh?"

"Not certain?" piped up Lieutenant Stanley.

"Stan, I've been under the alert watch of at least one armed guard continuously since these books entered my possession: if there's a way you think I could be *certain* about the origins of the annotated cumshot, I'm a little curious what role you think everyone would have played."

"Oh, I can imagine you holding a variety of positions.*

"The fuck excuse us?"

"You're saying you've seen enough cum stains to be confident?"

"Uh, yes? Stan, I've been in a barracks with sixty lonely men for the past six weeks. How long have *you* been deployed?"

"Uh, I never-" "Oh, *that* explains some things."

Commander King walked in, like Casey in Party Down, "Okay, if you guys are still talking about me than I am going to freak the *fuck* out"
