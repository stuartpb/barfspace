# Federated / Decentralized Note Hub

This is meant to be a more concrete spinoff of [Smuggler's Cove](58d3072a-0670-4bc3-9db2-fca214ca725e.md) (which can now focus on more philosophical topics)

This is all about decentralized and federated web(like) tech.

## Studying up

here are some [Journals](9403033b-a238-47d1-865b-4e1baa0f2577.md) studying tech for this:

- Decentralization protocols
  - [IPFS](24079268-feb1-43bd-93ae-daff3da9062e.md)
  - [Dat](435af1fd-1d1c-42b6-a591-bfa12141c031.md)
  - [Noise Protocol](42a57674-e119-4e36-a859-55901b6b0f6e.md)
- Federation Protocols
  - [Social Web Protocols](9c65b28f-122d-4243-a346-a5fabd31d7ad.md)
  - [Solid](a493d77d-4f53-4a67-90be-d6d5baa7be12.md)

## State of the Future

There are a few movements going on right now:

- the Indie Web, which focuses on Microformats to share between individually-owned-and-operated platforms
- the Fediverse, which focuses on ActivityPub to share across many collectively-operated communities
- the Decentralized Web, which focuses on rethinking the "operation"

The first two are captured by the Social Web Protocols, and the last one by Solid.

## related

- [Portable Identity](64a52921-8c92-40bb-a0e5-16414cc96d18.md)
  - will probably lead out to a larger "matters of identity" hub at some point
  - this can be extra important

## a thought

You could have ActivityPub streams served over Dat

does Dat support killing old blocks? I imagine probably not, I think hash integrity would be compromised?

## Projects

Here I could list a bunch of my projects and what part of the centralized world they replace, or how they serve federation

- [this page on the original intention of Lean Notes back when it was Glass Tubes](0350c64c-4975-42fc-91ca-92007cd9bcaa.md)
  - lays out what could be a compelling killer app for the Fediverse
  - this is starting to evolve into a real KubeApps running box
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline](a4698628-2fba-4d14-9f31-72b8e9688445.md) is definitely ActivityPub-friendly
