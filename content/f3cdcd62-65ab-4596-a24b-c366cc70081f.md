# August 2019 stushiba AUR cleanup

Wanting to update my Minecraft launcher, I've decided to `yay -Syu`

```
:: Searching AUR for updates...
 -> Missing AUR Packages:  gtk-xfce-engine
 -> Orphaned AUR Packages:  lib3ds  scribes
 -> Out Of Date AUR Packages:  minecraft-launcher  xi-core-git

```

Holding back:

- scite: I mostly installed this because, several years back, I knew it from Lua for Windows. I don't think it was AUR at the time
- tea: Another text editor I installed way the hell back when also not an AUR package, IIRC.
- signal: as I said [a few days ago for stuzzy](60ee4eff-905f-4c7d-ae82-b6f0e268c789.md), fuck Signal Desktop

I'm also going to get rid of `scribes` (another text editor I no longer care for) and `gtk-xfce-engine` (no idea what happened with this or what it did).

Keeping `lib3ds` because it's a dependency for Meshlab (which I do sometimes use).

Installying these updates got `go`, which I'm keeping because, you know, I ought to get around to doing some Go stuff.

Running `yay -R scribes scite signal tea gtk-xfce-engine`
