# stuvern mk 1

This was another early attempt at keeping an informal log of my process when instantiating a pet system, written this time for a virtual machine on Linode.

There's only one entry, as I believe I ended up moving over to DigitalOcean (as it was cheaper) shortly after setting this up.

## Changelog

There is one changelog for this system, circa [2013-09-02](9671256c-8728-4b44-a3af-2869b8b3735e.md).
