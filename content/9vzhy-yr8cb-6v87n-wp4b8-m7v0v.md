# Binder (Explorer / Finder System)

this was the idea for Binder (partially - the internal data source for icons and bookmarks, and customizing those, was also a thing, as part of a browser extension - and incorporating scriptlets was also a part)

might have notes around this in Google Keep?

it bubbled up in an idea to use it [for kubernetes](k2ecq-hqxgs-ccax1-s1p85-59s4s)
