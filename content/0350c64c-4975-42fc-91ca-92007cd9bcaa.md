# Like the Wizards: Pipelines, Automation, and Lean Notes

From a lingering Automation list in the Plans board, with one card entitled "Oh yeah, remember how that was supposed to be a thing?"

I guess the idea was originally to make this into one big "Website Setup Wizard", with pieces that could be dropped in as relevant, but, like... I'm thinking about what a pain that'd be to maintain. Like, look how much of the stuff I describe in here has completely changed in a Kubernetes world.

But yeah, this was the idea of the site when it was called "Glasstubes": to have a site where I could just go "I have an idea for a thing!" and it would set up a domain, a Twitter account, a Heroku app, a GitHub org, a Kubernetes cluster and CI solution, and have everything hooked up and ready to go...

This might be a sensible idea for a distributed app out-of-the-box structure, actually.
