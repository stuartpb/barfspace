# What We Talk About When We Talk About Cryptofascism

To set the scene, imagine you've got some William F. Buckley type on one side of the table, and some Gore Vidal type on the other, and they're talking about what color to paint a house.

"Well, it seems to me, that the best things in life, are the things that are bright crimson, the color of a stop sign, and things that are gold, like a buttercup. It would then follow that the house might best be painted in something that might approximate a combination of these two hues..."

"You're talking about orange."

"Well hey now, I said, hold on a minute, I never said orange."

"You were talking about a mixture of red and yellow."

"Ah, I do believe, sir, if you'll go back and check the record, I, *(chuckles, rolls eyes slightly)* I never said either of *those* words, either..."

"Okay, well, you were talking about things that *are* red and yellow, mainly because you were trying to get to your point, which was that you want to paint the house orange."

"Now excuse me, excuse me here, I never said a *whiff* of orange, and I take offense to the *suggestion* I might have wanted to paint the house orange, I find orange a *garish* color, now what -"

"You find it garish? Then what color were you driving at then, right now? What does this perfect house color look like, in your mind?"

"- if you'll let me finish, what I was *going* to say, was that the house should be painted a kind of rosy, autumn color, the color of the horizon line at sunset, a brilliant smattering of..."

"The word you're looking for is 'orange'."

"Now there you go *again*! This is the third or fourth time you've brought up orange, *you're* the one who keeps bringing up orange, *I* haven't wanted anything to *do* with the idea, and here you go *again*, trying to rope me into some kind of debate over orange."
