## bagtent markdown style stuff

link names should be treated as more or less portable between documents, which is to say that there shouldn't be any words that are used consistently to refer to different documents in different contexts (like `[back]:` pointing to the "previous page", for some kind of sick cheap templating scheme). Doing stuff like that screws with the tooling heuristics, not to mention it makes it harder to move content around.

the one exception to this is links by number, which have all kinds of special handling in the tooling

## also

this has a few references lingering around in other notes before I had a certain place to put them, but footnotes should live close to their point of usage, because it makes trucking content across files easier. It also leaves fewer dead references that have no links in the body hiding in the gaps.
