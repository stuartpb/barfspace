Running `sudo pacman -Syu`, then installing f2fs-tools.

Before I take this flash disk (the original storage for stuzzy) out of the drive bay it's been sitting in, I want to clobber the data that was previously on it by repurposing the drive to some other ends.

I install `f2fs-tools` and `hdparm`...

I'd like to completely reset this drive, so I look at https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Solid_state_drive/Memory_cell_clearing, and it's got some interesting suggestions, but it notes that the drive shouldn't be wiped over USB, so I'll try messing with the drive later (after using `hdparm` to check that I *can* do this), probably on stushiba.

## much, much later

I drag a 256x256 PNG I have lying around on a flash drive and copy it to my home directory as `.face`.

## GNOME system monitor

Googling for ways to display the system load in the GNOME shell (having waited several minutes for Google Chrome to load with no indication as to why this'd be an issue), I land on https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/120/system-monitor/, which gets me to install the GNOME Shell integration Chrome extension, and `sudo pacman -S chrome-gnome-shell`.

I make a bunch of changes to the configuration, mostly hiding text and the icon, shortening graphs to be 30 wide, showing the tooltip, and changing the alpha of Cache in the memory graph to 25% (since Cache doesn't really count as memory usage, and shouldn't be the brightest color. I never understood why that was the default.)

To see if I can get fan data, I run `sudo pacman -S lm_sensors`, then (per [the wiki page](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/lm_sensors)) `sudo sensors-detect`. The thing for fan sensors still says "Please install lm-sensors", so it looks like that didn't do anything.
