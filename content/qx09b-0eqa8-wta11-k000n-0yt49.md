## anyway

I started writing a bit for Silicon Valley based on a gag I started doing in the huttj Slack: [Venture Capitalist Optimization](4t6p4-z4x67-w39mh-pewjw-5krr7)

I also thought it could be cool to have a little scene in Mr. Robot explaining why fsociety would have *encrypted* E Corp's data instead of just *destroying* it, which itself has larger implications for the nature of disrupting capitalism: [The Key](jmqss-3fwsd-w8agr-d0fey-zdk4m)

I've also had a thought about how the second half of Tomorrowland could have been written a lot better, and how there's a better production of that story, [just a dream away](k150f-1xx9y-rq9nr-8ce0f-vaq89).

Actually, it's a lot like this pitch I'd been working on for a while: [Let's Talk Tommy](f6y9w-410s4-ws8e4-3axkn-14frj)

An idea for another episode of Black Mirror: [Face to Faiths](m2bpa-hv14m-r59vw-pj855-c0cwx)

There's this whole other spec that had emerged for me, for Atlanta: [Live Performances Nightly](ra1x8-b5f3f-wc8sz-6rhtt-eg2g5)

I've also had this idea for how I'd want to approach a reboot of [Daredevil](3s878-hap9n-v680a-3jrd7-hv83n).

That same kind of thought process led to [The Batfather](a8sr6-xha7m-mt9vg-kz9wt-vm08v).

Speaking of DC, I've also thought of a [Martian-Manhunter-oriented Justice League](63yf5-bab00-7e9x8-0s41x-gf843) pitch. (don't look it's bad)

I've also had thoughts going *way* back, about how I'd continue [Angel](tfkgh-wmffr-r08v8-1xef1-qevg5).

And, by this point, you can imagine I've got a thing or two to say about the concept of [fanfiction](qnsf4-2ssfj-88924-gtgvg-77h4j)

At the end of the season where Dennis left It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, I thought of a spec script for how I would address the question of his wanting to leave the past behind him, and the folly of doing so: [Mister Reynolds' Neighborhood](84pa9-rfk96-rh8fc-qbfvn-840mn)

Pitch for [Air Bud 7](tn9z7-ykcv1-ch9tb-bstc7-69g0e).

started writing a scene for [Avenue 5](t1krj-p5a4b-47a3m-2c5v5-tv8w1)
