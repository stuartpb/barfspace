# Department of Barfspace

This is an index of everywhere in Barfspace I've written plans to develop or alter the structure of pages in some way.

It'll also probably turn into a nexus for the codification of processes that get followed in these notes somewhat? IDK, that might be implying more cohesion to this editing than can ever really be hoped for

TODO: link to the name explainer page for "barfspace", maybe merge this next section into that so it's not taking up space here

## On naming this page

I'm actually partial to describing this page as "The Department of Barfspace" now, since that covers the two bits I keep thinking of when trying to name it, and "Barfspace" has become a term that is pretty much only still in use via its connection to these pages, so using it as a shorthand for "construction / improvement" is... Orwell-tastic.

## The Quests

The "Barfspace Arc" of [Quests][] was eventually divided up into three "domains":

- [Barfspace Operations][], dealing with legacies, maintenance and the like
- [Barfspace Visions][], dealing with new explanatory content and structure, aspirations like that
- [Barfspace Implementations][], dealing with tooling etc

[Quests]: 6f25cf97-8ee8-460e-9db8-3c241cadbff0.md
[Barfspace Operations]: a3f1fbb2-28c2-43b2-950d-6d5b7af7cd64.md
[Barfspace Visions]: a8c1b237-886b-4169-88ff-9e52bc1dbcf2.md
[Barfspace Implementations]: 30ec2e6e-47d0-496a-a523-0732b35aea8a.md

These are kind of... artifact-y, as a lot of them are kind of... inline-musing-heavy, rather than being things I actually knew what I wanted to do and how. If I ever revisit Quests versus Other Kinds of Notes, and shaping up the way I structure that tradeoff, I think it'll have to be that Quests should only be written after I've been thinking about a thing for like a week and just need to write down what I have in mind (like whatever I'm doing with Plushu, I guess?)

## Operational Plans and Reflections

This is for sussing out the structure of a plan itself. For following its implementation (so far as anything needs to be done point-by-point, instead of in one big commit), see [Barfspace Operations][BOPS].

## Implementation Adjunct

Since the [Implementation and Tooling Quests][BITQ] are in a kind of funky place, this is the headquarters for collecting plans and thoughts around the implementation, too.
