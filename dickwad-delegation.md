# Dickwad Delegation

A constant theme that I've found with the rich and ignorant is that they all seem to believe they can delegate things and have them magically turn out the way they're imagining.

Something about narcisissm makes them completely unable to recognize where their imagination ends and other peoples' experience begins, so they all do things like hand you cocktail napkins and saying "Make this".

The more classic, immediate example that's familiar to me is "turn this into a website", where they'll hand you a document with no structure and several important conjoining pieces of context missing, then be mad when those missing pieces of context didn't magically materialize in your translation.
