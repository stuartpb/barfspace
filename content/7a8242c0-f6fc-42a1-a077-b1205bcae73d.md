### another problem essentially caused by all-repo-fonts

Chrome has been hitching. Turns out it's because [it's processing every font on the system, for some reason](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=904994), of which I have like a thousand because I have the entire Google Fonts repository installed. Considering switching to Firefox until this issue is fixed. (Found through [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/archlinux/comments/9wnur4/chromium_and_googlechrome_lag_problem/) Reddit thread.)
