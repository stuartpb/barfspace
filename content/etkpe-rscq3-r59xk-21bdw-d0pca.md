# sturl new case + fan

I ordered one more 4GB Raspberry Pi 4B for sturl after seeing the system struggle to come online with the 2GB Pi.

I originally printed a case with a 30mm hole for a fan, not realizing that the heat sinks I'd put on the 2GB Pi (which I originally bought for sturl) meant there wasn't enough room for it. Now that I had a new Pi, I could install the fan without hainvg to pull the heatsinks off the old one.

had to cut some steel-sheet screws to secure the fan, and cut + crimp the fan's power cable - wasn't able to fit the Dupont shells on the crimped connections because there wasn't enough room. Had to pull the shells off and bend the crimps to fit.
