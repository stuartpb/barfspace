 a dead-simple relay-based independent-client-controller-circuit that just has all clients share a line with unlimited players allowed

- you could even have WS2812s on the "light" line
- oh man, could you cheat at this by making a controller that only buzzes in when it detects someone else is about to (in a way that could lock them out)?
- maybe there needs to be a "fairness test" mode to see that the controller operates correctly, and has no special parts (like an ESP8266 and a gyro that makes it only cheat at certain angles)
- oh man, they could be like QI buttons
