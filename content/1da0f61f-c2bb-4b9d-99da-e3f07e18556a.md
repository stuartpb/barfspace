# The Current Report of Broken Notes

There was an older iteration of this called [Project Akira][] that originally grew out of the [meditation][Meditations] for [My Old Bad Ideas][].

This is now the main note for the continuing work from that project under the [Department of Barfspace][DoB]. It's kind of a cursor for where a bunch of legacy work is at: a base camp to address newer developments in while trying to disassemble incomplete thoughts from a different time into pieces of a newer world, for structures from before the notes started coming in.

I guess this could also be thought of as a sort of Ellis Island, a receiving port for outside content, since so much of it pertains to integrating material from my pre-merger writings.

maybe this can become an ongoing Operation Trapper Keeper, and Project Akira was just the first phase - I think that pretty much reflects the thinking behind these two pages' establishment.

## anyway

2019-05-07: Making a note here that I should revisit the Project Akira Great Notes Consolidation page to reflect on its thoughts as they pertain to how the issues I was writing about then have evolved and are evolving.

(a note here about developing a more robust archaeological infrastructure, inspired by a reread of the notes on Project Akira, has been moved to [how-i-roll's Tomb][])

ALSO, [petlogs should get merged into these notes][petloggins] (I believe this is now tracked elsewhere, so this line can probably get cut)

The "Right Now" page has been reduced to basically a redundant version of the first list on the root note, since it was originally created as "the stuartpb.plan of the notes", and then that role kind of ended up being subsumed by whole blossoms of more-focused pages, so... yeah, that's the best I can do for now.

I've got a few fixes I want to do on various projects that I've been keeping in a Google Keep note, that is now moved [here][deprechaun]

Most of the stuff on this page that was still relevant has been packed up and moved to [Barfspace Operations][] - it's currently just become a historical landmark as "The Triage Site", where it was used to refer to the kind of legacy work Operations was meant to cover (it should really be renamed "Ongoing Legacy Quests")
