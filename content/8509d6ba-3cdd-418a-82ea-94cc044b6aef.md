# The BarfSpace Incubator&trade;

This is *far* from a comprehensive list of all my project ideas: *that* list is up on https://unusual.studio/projects.

However, sometimes that page needs a place to reference project ideas, and sometimes, those project ideas live here:

- [bagtent][] (the tools and spec that govern barfspace itself)
  - [Workflowy-style bagtent editor][borkflowy]
  - [The Bagtent Intelligence Project][BISNES/BIGDOG]
- [This thing with the Hashblots][mindsweeper]
- [wayside][]
- [plushu][]
- [3D Printing Stuff][]
- [postdark][]
- [timetress][]
- [Universal Issue Tracker][]
- [The Clusterhood][perfect-workspace.md]
- [Ultimate Secret Trump][]
- [A local-Let's-Encrypt-certificate-provisioning service][LocalLetsEncrypt]
- [Parked Project (Redux)][PPR]
- [KDE Connect, But Without the KDE][remote]
- [Squorum (boxesin redux)][]
- [Erisel, the Modular Federated Timeline][Erisel]

There's also [this page with some other pages that were originally considered projects unto themselves][etc], but that's not really the same thing

For other context that *might* explain some of these, see [Right Now][] and [News][].

It's important to note that the UUIDs used *here* have no relation to the UUIDs used elsewhere (ie. for reference in Unusual Studio) - a UUID refers either to a project listing there, or a document here. Any project that's listed both here *and* there is going to have two separate UUIDs, [and that's the way it should be](https://github.com/stuartpb/leannotes/issues/8).
