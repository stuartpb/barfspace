# plans for bagtent itself

This is going to be my little scratchpad for initial ~~thoughts~~ plans on bagtent itself for a moment

actually this is just for plans, [this page][using] is for reflections, and together *these* are the "thoughts"

I really really need to revisit the barfspace meta stuff soon so I can suss out what a project page specifically for barfspace would look like - I want to write some stuff about the autocommit shotclock, which should really live in its own repo like `git-slum`, and I just had the thought that it should have a "don't autocommit when tests are failing" function so that I could use it for barfspace and just have it test against `bagtent-orphans` so I can keep on using `bagtent-conjure` until I get `bagtent-sprout` made, and maybe also a test against null links

the perfect name for the strings that bagtent-top-links works on that Markdown uses for links and everything should be "footnames" (maybe that should be the new name for bagtent-top-links, bagtent-footname?)

bagtent should have a web uihttps://movies.stackexchange.com/a/1549/12626

holy crap I just re-realized that top-notes is actually an *excellent* system for, like, the thought I'm having right here, is, like, when there's an xkcd I like to pull out a lot, I can just type the name I usually use for it, and bam presto, there it is

## workflowy thing?

I'm also thinking, like, have it be something that can work like workflowy? like, every time there's a list and a link, do the search thing, and have "create (literal symbol)" as an option at the end to create a new page, which is inline-inserted

maybe have an extension that lets you open a new document (with a link to the current page or whatever) and works like the bagtent-sprout script, in that you have to pick a document to add it to (from a dropdown that sorts by pages with most inter-content links)

## here's where I got onto thinking about sprout proper

that can actually be a feature in bagtent-sprout, it looks up which files have the most outbound links and suggests them for addition first

similarly, that can be the main heuristic (or, rather, default sort heuristic, or maybe just a tiebreaker)

### figuring out the interactive selection menu

each menu takes either a search string, a number, or maybe a colon-prefixed line that's a command like `:sort inbound:ascending,match` to make longest-match only the tiebreaker sort for pages with the fewest inbound links (or you could even sort outbound first)

maybe that should be how the line works by default, there's number prompts, letter commands, and then like vi/less, you can type `/` or `:` or `-` or `+` to do searches, commands, or param settings (respectively). maybe also have something like a backtick for prefix-split (ie. the default for non-alias) and  `~` for fuzzy searches? and maybe `'` for literal search (closing single quote is optional and is treated like closing brace in `test`, where it ignores only the last one if present)?

maybe `#` searches by page title, and `[` searches by link name (again, discardling last brace if present)

how do I inject a suggested character to the read buffer? do I just have to listen for backspace and fake having a character in the buffer before the actual start of the line? wait, why did I care about this

I'm thinking all configuration can be by environment variables, `BAGTENT_DEFAULT_FIRSTLINK_SORT` or stuff like something like that

don't forget that all this would also be useful for a "select a file to open in $EDITOR or the given command" tool, or something where its default behavior is... the editor one, but it can also be run with an option like `-o` which will `echo` the filename

actually, no, terrible idea, the menu script should be the root, and then there are lightweight wrappers around that for editing - that also allows it to be used for rig and sprout

oh, a thing I guess I didn't cover here is that you can use the same menu system for a default "here's all the available content by some hot topic sort algorithm", and you can also use it for disambiguation (so like sprout might have a `--prompt` option, but by default it only prompts if the given search string for the file to prompt off of

i was thinking `-U` could be an "ignore matches in UUIDs" option, for instance I had a UUID earlier that matched "007" and if I wanted to search for "007" as a page title, I would have been clobbered with unrelated references. But, in general, I actually  do want it to be possible to refer to a page by part of its UUID

maybe the default list if nothing is specified is the links in README.md in order. also "list links from X file" should totally be a command, where it can (potentially?) spawn a submenu (like, a further instance) to select

oh hey, is there maybe a way to autocomplete? like, if we just go full-curses, maybe we can do the thing (when not falling back to readline or whatever) where we hint what the current #1 selection would be, and/or show the list live-updating? (so "enter" selects when it's unambiguous, and goes to the menu if it's ambiguous, and you pick the #1 quickly by just double-tapping enter to select the current caret option as soon as you're at the menu)

if we can lay this out in the terminal, it'd definitely make sense to have the menu search at the top (like Atom's quick search which this is so closely inspired by)

when grepping, the first line of every file should also be included in the search space (did I already cover this somewhere? they'd have options for excluding one or the other?)

weird blip thought: these notes are like the raw version of what my programs look like, like this is the primordial ooze, the egg whites of what I do: it's just a bunch of random thoughts that dictate the program's behavior, but there's no attempt to structure them - they define a consistent whole, but it's like getting snapshots of different parts of an elephant. Programming is the act of putting all those parts together.

more on track: there should be a mechanism when rigging to say "use the full version of what I typed, replace it", or not, because I'm not wild about long-ass link names propagating through substitution... is this maybe what I was talking about above with the ~ prefix? that can do a fuzzier search (ie. not going to search on boundaries, each space-separated word is going to be between `.*`), and when rigging, it will replace whatever the selected match was. (usually, I know the name I want to rig with, and I want it to be short)

that substitution thing can be useful when your page has only a long title, though... idk

don't forget that multiple matches (like `quests` might find the page linkes as `quests` or `main-quests`) should consolidate to one entry with a higher total

also, a thought from earlier is that there should be a linter for multiple instances of the same link on a page with different names (is there already a Markdown Lint for this?)

### this section got so bloated it needed its own page

I can also use `bagtent` to demonstrate how an ideal version of git's "[did you mean][]" would work

## bagtent markdown style stuff

link names should be treated as more or less portable between documents, which is to say that there shouldn't be any words that are used consistently to refer to different documents in different contexts (like `[back]:` pointing to the "previous page", for some kind of sick cheap templating scheme). Doing stuff like that screws with the tooling heuristics, not to mention it makes it harder to move content around.

the one exception to this is links by number, which have all kinds of special handling in the tooling

## tree spec stuff

another thing I'd like to add is a script that adds / allows for a metadata file listing content files that don't accept new internal links, eg. for deprecating a page

### authorship / acl structure thoughts

could also allow for some kind of ACL structure, where all commits from "owners" of various files are auto-merged (so long as they're appropriately rebased)

ownership and selections like that can recursively delegate by link (in a second system that maybe compiles into a raw UUID list, or maybe it's a directory of "maintainers" or "owners" by username/owner name, or owners themselves have UUIDs - actually, let's say the user system would work by directories, where the user directory names can be whatever you want), but you probably want that to be filtered by stuff like "child that only has parents/inbounds under this root" or "isn't owned by one of these / any users"

exclusive ownership can also be handled by some higher-level thing that can reject multiple ownership by checking some extended constructs

maybe that directory can be "authors"

you can have authors updated by some kind of CI or tooling or whatever from content (or vice versa), but that's your own thing to figure out (in that case, you can make your authors by UUID of the file that defines them)

### aliases and refs

there's also of course aliases (maybe that'd be the default namespace for non-numeric or prefixed lines - and aliases that are numbers get populated as default options, if they're within the range of the list)

part of me feels like aliases should be called refs, but, nah, refs are namespaced, aliases live in one namespace (though I guess that namespace allows directory separators)

since symlinks were grody but I don't like the idea of just using the ref style unbidden, what about storing filenames by UUID (or just UUIDs) in refs/aliases? maybe they should be full filenames like `content/whateveruuid.md`, so aliases can also refer to assets and things like that.

you can have a switch for sprout and bagtent-open or whatever that's "if the given name matches an alias, you can skip the prompt step because that alias is unambiguously what I meant"

anyway this would also work for other types of potential refs like `refs/bookmarks`, which might work like `heads` for choose-your-own-adventure traversals (where the bookmark is moving while the person reads), or for documentation explorations.

reminder that the preferred mechanism for building any kind of real structure in bagtent is a document of UUID links, even if it's not going to live in the repository proper. Like, I've thought about having a "scratchpad" which is just a bunch of unaffliated pages that link out to the repo being read, and that's how you can build, like, your own annotated copy, or own table of contents or quick-reference cheat sheet or whatever

### mixed data stuff

I recommend having a restriction against any two data types (content, authors, assets, etc) share a UUID if one isn't directly defined by the other (though things like a scheme where there's a subdirectory of assets as attachments to content, it's OK to structure those by UUID of the content they're attached to, as that's not a structure the way "an asset" is)
